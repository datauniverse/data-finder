the convention, while on WP it is <i>whatsit distribution</i>. I like the latter, but I\'m surprised to see that no <i>whatsit random variable</i> redirects exist. For example, <a href="/wiki/Normal_distribution" title="Normal distribution">normal distribution</a> but not <a href="/wiki/Normal_random_variable" class="mw-redirect" title="Normal random variable">normal random variable</a>? Surely the latter is a legitimate page title and thus a candidate for a redirect. It\'s a <a href="/wiki/Constant_random_variable" class="mw-redirect" title="Constant random variable">long time</a> since I\'ve thought about such things, but can anyone tell me if there is a good reason where there are so few redirects from <i>... random variable</i> to <i>... distribution</i>?

PM was only showing the current article and those versions modified in the past couple of weeks. He said he\'d restore them from backups, but I figured I\'d mention it here in case you all are looking, and because I\'ve run into a new problem. Some articles I try to view on PM are just blank, for instance <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=3351">[1]</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=3948">[2]</a>.

I suggest the creation of a new policy for Wikipedia math articles: the creation of secondary/supporting articles, which contain derivations, minor proofs, or detailed bibliographic references. Think something along the lines of "talk" pages, except that they\'re "proof" pages. They are out-of-line (since they\'re mostly boring). Thier use would not be encouraged, except in such cases where the validity of a formula may be questionable to some readers (e.g. may have been challenged in a talk page, or may be \'less than obvious\' in some way).</p>\n<p>The goal of such articles would be to improve the verifiability of the correctness of the content of articles given in wikipedia. I envision the day, many years from now, when WP is not \'just\' an encyclopedia, but is a reference that is comprehensive, as comprehensive as e.g. Abramowitz &amp; Stegun is for special functions. When it gets that big, there is the potential problem of asking whether a given formula is truly correct; the answer to which is invariably a proof. We may as well start talking about this now, and experiment with a few \'house styles\' for handling this.</p>\n<p>In the interim, how about adding a status category for PM articles: <b>Derivation/Proof</b>? The PM proof articles ... well, I don\'t really want to mark them as <b>Needs to be copied</b> since frankly the need is not so great, at least, not now; these can be defered. There\'s more important stuff now. But I do not want to mark them as <b>Not needed in WP</b>, since, frankly, they are needed.

I would suggest that Linas give a very careful thought to what he would actually like to do, and post it at the usual place, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics</a>. <a href="/wiki/User:Oleg_Alexandrov" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 22:17, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Status_of_automated_updates_.28it_seems_it_works.29">Status of automated updates (it seems it works)</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics/PlanetMath_Exchange&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16" title="Edit section: Status of automated updates (it seems it works)">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>I finished and tested the code for automatically updating things from PlanetMath. I must say it took forever for me to finish that, both because of technical issues (like Wikipedia changing some of their protocols, etc), and due to my laziness.</p>\n<p>But either way, I mirrored this project at <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Oleg_Alexandrov/PlanetMath_Exchange/&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov/PlanetMath Exchange/ (page does not exist)">User:Oleg Alexandrov/PlanetMath Exchange/</a>, and then wrote over it the updates from PlanetMath. So, if you visit that page, go to each individual lists, and do a diff of the current version (with updates from PlanetMath) and the one before it (which is just a copy of what we have here), you will see what the changes are.</p>\n<p>Two remarks are in order. First, on PlanetMath they sort the articles alphabetically, with the exception of the names of mathematicians, which are sorted by last name, and with the exception of article titles starting with formulas, which are sorted separately. I was not able to reproduce that, I sort everything alphabetically, so in a few places things are a bit displaced.</p>\n<p>Second, now all the sections are sorted by section number. Before that, the order was a bit strange, and I suspect I might have inherited that from the PlanetMath structure. So in some (just a few) places, some sections are interchanged.</p>\n<p>I looked at around 10 diffs and it seems my script does not screw anything up (except it removed some of Paul\'s comments which were not attached to a specific article, but rather, to certain sections; but that happened only in one section, and is I think, not crucial).</p>\n<p>When you get to it, I would like to ask you to check some diffs too, to see if there are any problems. Then, at some point, we will need to stop the work on our project for around 15 minutes to do the updates. This does not have to happen anytime soon, as we do have still plenty of work.</p>\n<p>Our exchange project is going well, and I (and hope you too) am happy. <a href="/wiki/User:Oleg_Alexandrov" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 01:14, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Brilliant, Oleg! I checked 60-XX and 39-XX and they seemed to work fine. The only suggestion I would make is that if _NOTOC_ has been removed from the page, then it would save removing it again if it wasn\'t added in the update -- of course this is a very minor thing. Overall it seems to work very well; thank you! <a href="/wiki/User:Bjcairns" title="User:Bjcairns">Ben Cairns</a> 00:59, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC).</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>Ok, great, but how do I use this?

Some of the links are wrong, obviously, as on Wikipedia we could have a certain article named differently as on PM. If at some point you fix a certain wikilink as you convert an article, I could make sure that this correction applies throughout any future conversions containing this link. For that one would need to create a conversion table, where one could add a link which one fixed anyway. So, this is just something to be kept in mind. <a href="/wiki/User:Oleg_Alexandrov" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 20:27, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>Cool work on that script.

PM\'s <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=5792">dependence relation</a> uses "\\prec" function which doesn\'t parse, perhaps it could be converted into "\\le"? Converting <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=2024">"dynkin system"</a> generates a bunch of cruft at the end of the article.

(I feel a lot of peace in heart knowing that there is somebody out there taking care of vandalism. Today I saw somebody deleting a paragraph from <a href="/wiki/Real_number" title="Real number">real number</a>, made me depressed, really). <a href="/wiki/User:Oleg_Alexandrov" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 05:33, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>I finished implementing the automatic categorization of articles, based on the AMS subject classification. See also <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics#New_math_categories" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics#New_math_categories</a> for discussion about missing categories needed to make the correpondence between AMS subject classificaiton numbers and Wikipedia categories a well-defined function. <a href="/wiki/User:Oleg_Alexandrov" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 00:17, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>I replaced for now \\prec with \\triangleleft. This is a dirty hack, but can\'t think of anything else. <a href="/wiki/User:Oleg_Alexandrov" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 04:21, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>After the conversion to wikicode, some wikilinks are obviously wrong. For example, on Planetmath the link to "function" is for some reason called "image2.html" which is kind of silly. I am making a table listing PlanetMath links and their corresponding Wikipedia equivalents at <a href="/wiki/User:Mathbot/Mapped_links" title="User:Mathbot/Mapped links">User:Mathbot/Mapped links</a>. If there is any link which you encounter and need to fix again and again, you could just write it there, and my script will take care of them in future occurences. <a href="/wiki/User:Oleg_Alexandrov" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 00:53, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Oleg: PM articles seem to link "subset" to "inclusion", where we want "subset" (see for example 3692). I\'ve added this to the above list. Does your program access this file dymanically? Or do you have to updated it manually? At any rate your program still produces a link to "inclusion". <a href="/wiki/User:Paul_August" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Paul_August" title="User talk:Paul August">\xe2\x98\x8e</a> 04:30, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Well, first of all my program does not access that file dynamically, only when I chose to download it (I can easily make it dynamic, see what I did at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Old" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Old</a>, but then vandalism of that map of links could be of concern).</p>\n<p>I figured out why that "inclusion" link did not work.

Is it a good time to start adding new articles information from PlanetMath, or is it premature since there is still a lot of work? Just wondering.</p>\n<p>If the answer to this question is yes (and even if it is no, still useful for future reference), another question I want to ask is whether it is worth preserving comments made by us at the beginning of sections, as opposed to comments to individual articles (see <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Mathematics/PlanetMath_Exchange/03-XX_Mathematical_logic_and_foundations#03-00_General_reference_works_.28handbooks.2C_dictionaries.2C_bibliographies.2C_etc..29" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/PlanetMath Exchange/03-XX Mathematical logic and foundations">03-XX Mathematical logic and foundations</a> for an example). It looks to me that this kind of information would become partially obsolete when more articles are added.</p>\n<p>Or maybe the right thing to do is to actually have this kind of information at each section, and which would be updated automatically. Would such per section statistics be desirable?</p>\n<p>A third question is if links saying</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Duplicate entry</b>. See so and so...</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>which we have are useful or not.

Today I did two edits. The first, introduced a newline between rows and inserted the silly comment &lt;!-- begin row --&gt;. That is necessary, not because my bot is stupid, but rather because otherwise the wiki diffs become a sea of red. The comments above forces the wiki diff to compare things row by row.</p>\n<p>The second edit actually updated the stats (semiautomatically for now). One side effect here is that the obnoxious mathbot replaced all the other contributors\' signatures by its own. I could make the code not replace the signature in rows where no change occured to start with, but for now I am not sure it is worth bothering. The formatted table now looks a bit worse stylistically (you see some XX in places). I will trim them sometime. And eventually I plan to place a link under the table, which will refresh the stats on demand. <a href="/wiki/User:Oleg_Alexandrov" title="User:Oleg Alexandrov">Oleg Alexandrov</a> 07:56, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Excellent! The refresh button also sounds like a very good idea. My only quibble though is that the totals at the bottom were not changed. This seems like the sort of thing that the mathbot would be very good at. That seems much more important than the signatures issue (though maybe if the bot is replacing them all the time, we just shouldn\'t have a signature column). <a href="/wiki/User:Jtwdog" title="User:Jtwdog">Jtwdog</a> 16:45, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>The Automatic stats are great! As for Mathbot, he may not be stupid (that remains to be seen) but he is certainly an egotistical, glory-hogging, credit-stealing, upstaging little so-and-so! But I guess if he is going to do all the work, he should get all the credit. I hope he knows how to count! Perhaps if we are going to use mathbot exclusively to update the table, we could bring him down a notch or two, by dispensing with that column all together? Or perhaps we will need it for the occasional human intervention? Oh and having a link under the table to make Mathbot count on command sounds great! We should label it: "Go boy! Count!". I am having fun now imagining repeatedly commanding him to count over and over and over again until his little brain melts&#160;;-) Oh yeah and tell Mathbot to lose the "XX"s. <a href="/wiki/User:Paul_August" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Paul_August" title="User talk:Paul August">\xe2\x98\x8e</a> 16:51, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>Of course, the bot is just as stupid as its boss.

Some nits. Could Mathbot rather than entering a zero in the table leave the cell blank? This makes it easier to "read" the table, and for the NM, and NC columns, see more easily what has to be done. Also I think Mathbot has miscolored "97 Mathematics education". As regards the signatures, (show up in red?) , we could reinterpret the meaning of the last column to be, by whom and when, the last change was made to that particular category?
