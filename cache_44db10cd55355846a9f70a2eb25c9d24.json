Based on my reading of the discussion, there is consensus to use the Sc-Y-La-Ac periodic table as a default. Both periodic tables should be presented when the controversy in group 3 is relevant, but it need not be mentioned otherwise. For example, there is no need to link an alternative periodic table in the article about chlorine.\n<p>The primary reason this conclusion was reached by the participants of this discussion is because the Sc-Y-La-Ac periodic table has been shown to be the more common form, both in general texts and among researchers who study the dispute academically. The science-based discussion also seemed to favor the Sc-Y-La-Ac periodic table, but at minimum the Sc-Y-La-Ac periodic table did not appear to be outclassed by the Sc-Y-Lu-Lr table.</p>\n<p>The Sc-Y-*-** periodic table was discontinued by IUPAC during this debate, and was rendered historical. IUPAC is currently discussing this issue, but a decision is not expected to be finalized soon. If IUPAC decides on a Sc-Y-Lu-Lr periodic table, that will almost certainly require this discussion to be rehashed.</p>\nIt should be noted that I am not a chemistry expert; I have had some college level chemistry, but I may have easily missed a subtlety in this discussion.

There are a few reasons for this.\n<ol>\n<li>Firstly, this is the way the vast majority of chemists would have learned it, judging by how it is the dominant form in textbooks (I\'ve already listed five of the most commonly used inorganic chemistry textbooks in my opening paragraph, and not a single one uses anything other than Sc-Y-La-Ac). (You can read a chemist\'s incredulous reaction to the -Lu-Lr form in <a href="/wiki/Talk:Yttrium#Periodic_group" title="Talk:Yttrium">Talk:Yttrium#Periodic group</a> to judge how uncommon it is in academic circles that are not specifically debating the composition of the periodic table: Petergans seems to never have been aware of the -Lu-Lr option before this.) When common usage conflicts with IUPAC, the former generally wins on Wikipedia: hence we have articles on <a href="/wiki/Phosphine" title="Phosphine">phosphine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arsine" title="Arsine">arsine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stibine" title="Stibine">stibine</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bismuthine" title="Bismuthine">bismuthine</a>, instead of the IUPAC-approved <i>phosphane</i>, <i>arsane</i>, <i>stibane</i>, and <i>bismuthane</i>.</li>\n<li>Secondly, if we look at electron configurations in the solid phase (more relevant for chemistry than the usually provided gas-phase electron configurations), most of the lanthanides and actinides (with only seven exceptions out of thirty: Eu, Yb; Th, Es, Fm, Md, No) have an f<sup><i>n</i></sup>d<sup>1</sup>s<sup>2</sup> configurations. If you go across the lanthanide row, what appears to happen is that a 5d electron is added at La, and it stays there throughout as the 4f shell fills from Ce to Lu (except at Eu and Yb where it drops down to bring the 4f shell up to being half-filled or fully filled, but this is not a problem given that much the same thing happens with Cr and Cu as the 3d shell fills). Much the same happens for the actinide row. This implies that one column of the d-block fills, the f-block intervenes, and then the rest of the d-block fills. This is something you see in the Sc-Y-La-Ac table only, not the IUPAC Sc-Y-*-** table or the Sc-Y-Lu-Lr table currently given.</li>\n<li>Lastly, the IUPAC Sc-Y-*-** table is somewhat unsatisfactory as it does not provide a good answer to the composition of group 3. It seems to imply that there are 32 elements in group 3: Sc, Y, and all 30 lanthanides and actinides. This view has been held in the past, but it is emphatically not the view you will find in most textbooks <i>today</i> in English or German (don\'t know about other languages), which is that group 3 (like any other transition group) has only four elements: Sc, Y, La, and Ac. Even Cotton &amp; Wilkinson, while covering these elements with the other 14 lanthanides (Ce\xe2\x80\x93Lu) on the grounds of chemical similarities, specifically entitles the chapter "The Group 3 Elements and the Lanthanides", making it quite clear that these are separate categories. Furthermore, when expanded out into the 32-column format as in the footer, it seems to imply that the Sc and Y boxes be stretched to cover fifteen columns each, which is not something I have seen anybody at all seriously suggest.</li>\n</ol>\n</dd>\n<dd>In light of this, I support that <b>a Sc-Y-La-Ac table</b> be used instead of the current Sc-Y-Lu-Lr table or the ambiguous IUPAC Sc-Y-*-** table. I get the feeling that there is a tendency to overestimate the scale of the debate on the composition of group 3. It seems to stem largely from a vocal minority, including for example Jensen and Scerri, that has repeatedly argued for the Sc-Y-Lu-Lr table in many articles. But if you look at chemistry education circles, and what professional chemists think, the debate looks like it was concluded long ago in favour of Sc-Y-La-Ac. It does not hurt that there are also sound chemical arguments on this side. The navboxes and infoboxes would then be edited accordingly to move Sc and Y. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 08:47, 30 October 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="R8R_Gtrs_comments">R8R Gtrs comments</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Periodic_table&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: R8R Gtrs comments">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Questions">Questions</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Periodic_table&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Questions">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h5>\n<p>A couple of questions from me: <small>[R8R 10:35; <i>sign added to more easily follow threads. -<a href="/wiki/User:DePiep" title="User:DePiep">DePiep</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DePiep" title="User talk:DePiep">talk</a>) 13:56, 10 November 2016 (UTC)</i>]</small>:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the IUPAC choice, whatever it is, going to actually affect the decision?

Hence we have "phosphine" instead of "phosphane" and "ethylene oxide" instead of "oxirane". So, to my mind, it would not be much of a stretch to say "regarding periodic table layouts and classifications, such as group 3 and group 12, some articles may not follow IUPAC conventions provided that the alternative used is in fact at least as common in the scientific literature". <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 16:34, 30 October 2016 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>I am skeptical given we have <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ALUM" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ALUM">WP:ALUM</a>. Rules have been used somewhat deliberately. I sincerely don\'t see the point to force everyone to write "alumunium" when they use AmE: Americans don\'t use that! Likewise, the British use, to my knowledge, only "sulphur" and I don\'t see why they are forced to use the unusual for them spelling. We may stick to the IUPAC (though I wouldn\'t want to), but then we have no phosphane and that\'s inconsistent. So apparently we\'re on our own.--<a href="/wiki/User:R8R_Gtrs" class="mw-redirect" title="User:R8R Gtrs">R8R</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:R8R_Gtrs#top" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:R8R Gtrs">talk</a>) 11:41, 11 November 2016 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>I think the case of <i>sulfur</i> in the UK is different from the case of <i>aluminium</i> in the US, given that for the former the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sulphur">Oxford Dictionary</a> says \'The traditional British spelling is sulphur and the US spelling is sulfur. In chemistry and other technical uses, however, the -f- spelling is now the standard form for this and related words in British as well as US contexts, and is increasingly used in general contexts as well.\' We are not yet at the point where the spelling has been unified across the Atlantic, but we are getting close (which agrees with my experience). Besides, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v1/n5/full/nchem.301.html">IUPAC does not allow "sulphur"</a> for S.</dd>\n<dd>As for Al and Cs, I would argue that the concept of a primary spelling is very useful. Is the category going to be "Aluminium compounds" or "Aluminum compounds" when you have dozens of articles, some using "-ium" and others "-um"? IUPAC can only print one name for them in the periodic table, after all. I think it is clear here that "aluminium" and "caesium" are the primary names with the American spellings here being minor alternatives. I know "phosphine" ignores IUPAC entirely, but it is a different kind of issue, since nobody says "phosphane". Many people say "aluminium" and "aluminum". <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 11:57, 11 November 2016 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>I remember having seen a Canadian teacher complaining, "who uses \'sulfur\'?

We survive with <small><a href="/wiki/Category:Color" title="Category:Color">Category:Color</a></small> having a mix of "color" and "colour", after all. I suspect the real reason why the rule is the way it is is because the consensus at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(chemistry)" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (chemistry)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (chemistry)</a> is firmly in favour of using "aluminium" and "caesium" only. (BTW, looking at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ENGVAR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ENGVAR">WP:ENGVAR</a> and the article histories, this wouldn\'t actually change anything for the element articles, because they were all started at the IUPAC spelling; but perhaps some of the compounds might be different.)</dd>\n<dd>The main argument I see and am somewhat convinced by is that in the case of PH<sub>3</sub>, everyone calls it "phosphine", nobody calls it "phosphane", so we call it phosphine. That is straightforward. The case of Al is less straightforward. Most of the geographic world calls it "aluminium", but most papers you will see call it "aluminum", and given the percentage of Wikipedia viewers from the USA I suspect many will expect "aluminum", although perhaps not the majority. In such an unclear situation it is quite useful to have the IUPAC guideline. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 14:20, 11 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><span class="outdent-template" style="display:block; margin-top:-0.5em; color:#AAA;"><span style="display:inline-block; overflow:hidden;">\xe2\x94\x8c</span><span style="display:inline-block; overflow:hidden; word-wrap:normal; width:15.2em;">\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80</span><span style="display:inline-block; overflow:hidden;">\xe2\x94\x98</span></span>Are you both making an analogy between <i>preferred spelling</i> and <i>group 3 composition</i>?

(There are, of course, quite a few texts that use Sc-Y-* when group 3 is not important to what they are trying to say: I have ignored those as irrelevant per what you say.) Even Wulfsberg, which uses Sc-Y-Lu, does not really treat group 3 to a whole chapter the way, say Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw or Holleman &amp; Wiberg do. Even if we choose monographs, the only one I found covering group 3 apart from the lanthanides is R C Vickery\'s <i>Scandium, Yttrium, and Lanthanum</i> (published by Pergamon Press), whose support is evidently clear from his chosen title. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 08:21, 18 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Also_comments">Also comments</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Periodic_table&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Also comments">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h5>\n<p>Also a couple of comments: <small>[R8R 10:35]</small></p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>"The books do it, and thus so should we" and "look at the properties!" are quite contradictory lines of reasoning.

The current line on reasoning is one-sided. <small>[R8R 10:35]</small>\n<ul>\n<li>I did look at -Lu-Lr, didn\'t I? I looked at the solid-state electron configurations and noted that "This [the split d-block the configurations imply] is something you see in the Sc-Y-La-Ac table only, not the IUPAC Sc-Y-*-** table or the Sc-Y-Lu-Lr table currently given." Even Jensen (a noted -Lu-Lr proponent) writes that when positioning elements, you look <i>first</i> at electron configurations and only <i>second</i> at trends, and the first trumps the latter. Since both -La-Ac and -Lu-Lr give reasonable trends, but only -La-Ac fits the chemically useful electron configurations (and the idea of using solid-state ones as more chemically relevant is Scerri\'s), -La-Ac seems to win here. I could certainly make arguments for why the -La-Ac trend is better to show as primary than the -Lu-Lr trend, but why should I when I think the electron configuration argument settles it already? <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 12:19, 30 October 2016 (UTC)\n<ul>\n<li>On a brief read, this didn\'t look like all of Jensen\'s arguments have been taken in consideration. Besides, you decide that solid phase is more important than the gas state, which also cannot be taken for granted and only agreed on. Also, if (sure, if) I remember correctly, electron energies are close in almost all of these elements for the d and f configs, which (if I am right) diminishes the importance of this: Cr falls out of line, and so do Pd, Cu, Ag, etc.--<a href="/wiki/User:R8R_Gtrs" class="mw-redirect" title="User:R8R Gtrs">R8R</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:R8R_Gtrs#top" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:R8R Gtrs">talk</a>) 13:23, 30 October 2016 (UTC)\n<ul>\n<li>They really are not close in the cases of La and Ac.

So, while Ce\xe2\x80\x93Lu and Th\xe2\x80\x93Lr might be able to survive being stuck in the f-block, La and Ac seem to be very unhappy with it. At least for the transition metal anomalies like Cr, Cu, Pd, and Ag, the Aufbau-expected configuration is usually the first excited state even if it isn\'t the ground state. The Aufbau-expected configuration for La and Ac is nowhere near that. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 13:51, 30 October 2016 (UTC)\n<ul>\n<li>P.S. In many cases the Jensen arguments are lame. Some of them are disputed (4f involvement in La is highly suspect), some have been superseded by newer data (both La and Lu are superconducting at low temperatures), and even the chemical arguments stemming from the differences between Y and La (which aren\'t present for Lu) are simply a result of the larger size of La<sup>3+</sup> as compared to Y<sup>3+</sup>. I could use the exact same arguments to "prove" that Be and Mg do not belong in the same group as Ca. (For instance, Ca dissolves in liquid ammonia but Be and Mg will not; Ca metal is fcc while Be, Mg, and Zn are hcp; the mp and bp trends show a discontinuous jump from Mg to Ca but decrease smoothly from Mg to Zn; Ca has low-lying d-orbitals that can be used for bonding while Be and Mg do not; CaX<sub>2</sub> and MgX<sub>2</sub> for X = F, Cl, Br do not share the same structure; Be and Mg have a rich organometallic chemistry like Zn while Ca does not.) Yet no one would agree with that because these are all trumped by the electron configuration argument. If they can be used to prove something like this that no one would agree with today, why do they suddenly become useful and important when deciding on the composition of group IIIA? I don\'t think they do. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 01:45, 31 October 2016 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>Looks inconsistent to say that La is "unhappy" but Lu "might be able to survive being stuck" citing the data because when you look at Lu, they don\'t even show information for the 4f6s<sup>2</sup> config! How can you judge then? "In the case of Ac, the energy of the [Rn]5f17s2 configuration would be so high that ionisation actually takes place first." that sounds very unlikely. I\'d rather suggest they couldn\'t do much research because of a number of factors: a) actinium is rare, b) the research is difficult, c) actinium keeps decaying away, d) research costs money, e) radiation interferes with energies of electrons. They measured 6s<sup>2</sup>35f for Lu. Surely the same couldn\'t be impossible for Ac. Just more difficult.\n<dl>\n<dd>Of course Lu doesn\'t show any information for a hypothetical 4f<sup>15</sup>6s<sup>2</sup> (what?!?) configuration! The 4f orbitals can only hold fourteen electrons! If you take a Sc-Y-La-Ac table, the f-block starts at Ce and ends at Lu, you are saying that 5d<sup>1</sup> enters at La and is conserved throughout the next fourteen elements, so Yb is predicted as [Xe]4f<sup>13</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>6s<sup>2</sup> and Lu is predicted as [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>1</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>. You will notice that this is the same predicted electron configuration for Lu as with the Sc-Y-Lu-Lr table, so looking at Lu here is a little pointless. What we should be looking at is how much energy it takes to promote one 4f electron for Pr\xe2\x80\x93Yb (except Gd) to 5d (in favour of -La-Ac), compared to how much energy it takes to promote one 5d electron to 4f for La, Ce, and Gd (in favour of -Lu-Lr). The former always requires much less energy than the latter.</dd>\n<dd>Radium is also a strong radioactive, but somehow <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ASD/energy1.pl?conf_out=1&amp;term_out=1&amp;level_out=1&amp;j_out=1&amp;lande_out=1&amp;perc_out=1&amp;biblio=1&amp;spectrum=Ra%20I">we have data up to 7s52p</a>.

I\'ll take your word for "disputed." I\'ll say superconductivity never mattered to me anyway. However, "are simply a result of the larger size" is a huge deal and you put "simply" to possibly to underestimate the importance of this, while I immediately think, "if it\'s so simple, could it be it\'s a structural reason?" As for comparison with group 2, I think you\'re misinterpreting the argument in a way you wouldn\'t convince a -Lu-Lr supporter. Group 2 would be expected to show the change, as does its s-block mate, group 1. Group 3, on the other hand, would be expected to do what other early d-block groups do, especially groups 4 and 5, and -Lu-Lr fits that trend better.--<a href="/wiki/User:R8R_Gtrs" class="mw-redirect" title="User:R8R Gtrs">R8R</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:R8R_Gtrs#top" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:R8R Gtrs">talk</a>) 12:04, 11 November 2016 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>The reason I don\'t think it\'s important is that there are numerous examples throughout the periodic table where the universally-agreed placement <i>does not</i> result from Jensen-style arguments. I can even cite examples within the same group. It is well-known that Hg is very different from Zn and Cd. ZnF<sub>2</sub> and CdF<sub>2</sub> are like the alkaline earth fluorides in having high lattice energies and being sparingly soluble in water, but HgF<sub>2</sub> instead gets hydrolysed to HgO and HgF. Zn and Cd favour 4-coordinate tetrahedral complexes, but Hg actually favours 2-coordinate linear complexes. Now we ask: why does this happen? Due to the much higher effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons at Hg, Hg<sup>II</sup> compounds are singular in group 12 because of the intense polarising power of Hg<sup>2+</sup> and great covalent character of its compounds. The 2-coordination thing stems precisely from the ease of distortion of its electronic cloud due to its filled d<sup>10</sup> configuration poorly shielded from the nucleus by the f<sup>14</sup> configuration: if you have two ligands approaching a Hg<sup>2+</sup> cation from the <i>z</i>-axis, the electron density gets concentrated in the <i>xy</i> plane, so much so that other ligands find it difficult to approach. So we have the lanthanide contraction working both ways; at Hf, Ta, W, and Re, it makes the 6th-period element similar to the 5th-period-element, but when we get to Au and Hg it makes them very different. What all of this tells me is that we should consider such effects to simply be second-order course corrections. The periodic table is meant to show the most basic relationships, not things like the Al\xe2\x80\x93Fe link, the group <i>n</i>\xe2\x80\x93(<i>n</i>+10) relationships, and all that. Therefore we should not be looking at this sort of thing to place elements, but rather simply place them according to what subshells are active in their chemistry. This leads to a clear answer: 4f becomes active for the first time only in Ce, so that is the start of the f-block.</dd>\n<dd>As for group 3 being in the d-block: I think there is a fundamental difference between group 3 and group 4. The 4f electron level does not fall below the 6s level and become chemically active until Ce (and similarly the 5f electron level does not fall below the 7s level until Th). Thus the f-block cannot be considered to begin until Ce and Th, and <i>that</i> is where the lanthanide and actinide contractions begin, because it makes no sense to me to consider La an f-block element when 4f is not doing anything for its chemistry. From that basis, <i>of course</i> group 3 should not follow group 4; the latter comes <i>after</i> the lanthanide contraction, but the former comes <i>before</i> it! Therefore the irregularity of Hf being almost exactly like Zr should not be expected to occur in group 3. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 14:20, 11 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><span class="outdent-template" style="display:block; margin-top:-0.5em; color:#AAA;"><span style="display:inline-block; overflow:hidden;">\xe2\x94\x8c</span><span style="display:inline-block; overflow:hidden; word-wrap:normal; width:15.2em;">\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80\xe2\x94\x80</span><span style="display:inline-block; overflow:hidden;">\xe2\x94\x98</span></span> In the first para, you make a good point, a very good one. And it will be great if you show how this can be applied to gold, since gold mainly shows 3+ rather than +, but nonetheless I take your point on Hg. However, in the list of your arguments, some of which are very good, I find this one not nearly so. First of all, this one seems to apply to mercury only. I can\'t see how you could apply this to lanthanum, but I\'ll take it the periodic table is a bizarre place because when you want to draw some simple trends, it turns out not everything so so simple and the oversimplicity breaks down. Mostly because I wouldn\'t want to argue about that, as this moves from scientific to philosophical, and I just feel we\'re moving from the issue. So will also declare this to be not too relevant unless you show me it is.<br />\nThis is a La-centered argument, and a something-centered argument isn\'t the best. This one, I really don\'t like: you can replace "lanthanide contraction" with "d-block contraction" and see that Al should be located above Sc. See why you don\'t like that statement and how you would disprove that claim: this is exactly why how I would disprove yours.<br />\nI also want to specify that I am, and have throughout this discussion, arguing with your arguments rather than the idea they are intended to support. I\'d want to ask you: do you see the point (not if you agree with it; do you see it) behind me saying this all is a matter of preference rather than actual science? Don\'t even want to convince you this is the case; just genuinely interested to know the answer.--<a href="/wiki/User:R8R_Gtrs" class="mw-redirect" title="User:R8R Gtrs">R8R</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:R8R_Gtrs#top" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:R8R Gtrs">talk</a>) 15:18, 11 November 2016 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Yes, I think it is partially a preference thing. I think that the choice of -La-Ac and -Lu-Lr depends a great deal on the philosophy of what you think the periodic table is meant to show first. However, that basic philosophy also makes a difference on the conclusions you would draw on many other fraught elements in the table, like H and He, Be and Mg, etc. Thus my argument for -La-Ac is mostly based on the fact that the philosophy of the standard table, in its placement of those other elements, seems to point to a -La-Ac sort of philosophy for me.</dd>\n<dd>For example, to me the philosophy leading to -Lu-Lr is what Jensen and Scerri have said: we think of the table as being based on abstractions, like ideal electron configurations based on a simple rule like Madelung\'s. The table thus splits neatly into rectangular s-, p-, d- and f-blocks, and we judge things that way. Thus we look at group 3, and think \'oh, it should act like group 4, and not so much like group 2\'.</dd>\n<dd>However, I think the fact that we almost always shift helium to the noble gases illustrates to me that there are really grounds to break away from such a Platonic table when the chemistry does not support it. Instead of starting from the theory, and placing helium with the alkaline earth metals (complete with caveats as to its actual chemistry), here we have a profound statement in favour of scrapping the theory in a case like this in favour of what we experimentally see in chemical properties.</dd>\n<dd>I argue therefore that similarly, although the theory predicts that lanthanum and actinium should show f-orbital involvement, experiment says they do not. I see that every block of the standard periodic table only begins when its first subshell becomes chemically active, and the rest of the periods below it follow. This results in defining the theoretical blocks from the practical results, not forcing the practical results into a theory. The s-block starts at Li (ignoring the weird first row as an outlier), the p-block starts at B, and the d-block starts at Sc.</dd>\n<dd>I look at the Ca\xe2\x80\x93Sc divide, and note that Ca can occasionally be forced to use the 3d orbitals for supervalent hybridisation, but that 3d is an important part of Sc chemistry. Then I am reminded of La\xe2\x80\x93Ce, where La can occasionally be forced to use the 4f orbitals similarly, but 4f doesn\'t become important until Ce when it falls down in energy. (Yes, really: the source is 10.1021/ed8001286. This is what I was trying to say in the "lanthanide contraction" argument; I must not have expressed it well enough.) Then I think that if Ca isn\'t a d-block element even though it can use its d-orbitals in hybridisation, neither should La be an f-block element. And I look at the metallic lanthanides and I see that the d-electron added at La is mostly retained (only two exceptions, Eu and Yb); I look at the metallic transition metals, and the s-electrons added in groups 1 and 2 are similarly retained (only two exceptions, Rh and Pd). This is why I want to start the d-block at La and interrupt it for the f-block lanthanides, to more closely reflect when the f-orbitals first become active.</dd>\n<dd>And this results in a table that is consistent with our choice to move helium, because while the theory is perfectly happy with it above beryllium, almost every chemist who has worked with both elements would consider such a placement ridiculous. May I also add that it feels more comfortable to my preferred philosophy of science if our theories are based on the facts, instead of us forcing the facts to fit our theories?</dd>\n<dd>P.S. For gold, I would note that while Cu<sup>I</sup> and Ag<sup>I</sup> form aquo ions, Au<sup>I</sup> does not, and while Cu<sup>I</sup> and Ag<sup>I</sup> form complexes with unsaturated hydrocarbons, Au<sup>I</sup> does not. The +1 oxidation state for gold is known and is reasonably stable; it is indeed important in its extraction by formation of [Au(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>\xe2\x88\x92</sup>, although it is more susceptible to oxidation than for silver and so you have to keep it away from water (but once you do, there is no problem). You are right of course that it is easier to make this kind of point where all three elements in the group like to show the same oxidation state; but even here I can make the point about size again, because CuCl has the zincblende structure while AgCl has the rocksalt structure similar to NaCl and KCl. The issue is simply: are the ions roughly the same size (in which case you get the CsCl structure), is the cation a little smaller (in which case you get the NaCl structure), or is the cation <i>much</i> smaller (in which case you get the CuCl structure)? And the crucial thing is, the size is the <i>only</i> factor here, and it really has not much to do with how the elements actually behave as long as the stoichiometry works out. That\'s why, despite AgCl and NaCl having the same structure, Ag is very unreactive and Na is famously reactive. So to me, just saying that La is bigger than Y while Lu is about the same size by itself is not saying much. K is bigger than Na while Cu is closer to being the same size. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 15:56, 11 November 2016 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>This line of reasoning in incomplete in a way that I\'ve noted before: When you have an argument for -La-Ac, you are left to show the same couldn\'t be said about lutetium. If a comparison is impossible, then there is no point. You\'ve defeated my counter-argument to your argument above, which I made by mistake. But nonetheless, that doesn\'t make that argument of yours any better, and you had to replace it with another one, which I don\'t quite understand. See?</dd>\n<dd>I was unable to meaningfully apply your argument to lutetium and period 4.

If I look at the first row of the d-block, I notice that we start it at Sc where the 3d orbitals first become active and end it at Zn where they finally sink into the core and become chemically inactive. This is true for every row of every block except the s-block (we can take the activity of Kr, Xe, and Rn as a minor exception). A case could be made for starting it at Ca and ending it at Cu, because Ca shows some 3d involvement under extreme conditions, but that is not what we do. So this acts as the precedent I am citing.</dd>\n<dd>Now if I look at the first row of the f-block, I notice (citing Greenwood, Schwarz, Johanssen and many others) that the 4f orbital first becomes active only at Ce. <b>This</b> is the main point I am trying to make. Despite a flurry of speculations in the early 1980s literature, Sandbh and I were unable to find any further references which actually firmly substantiated 4f character in La, and even the "evidence" in the early 1980s literature for it could be more easily used to support the <i>absence</i> of 4f character. It is <i>because</i> of this that I think it is better to begin the f-block at Ce and create Sc-Y-La table, when the 4f orbitals first become active, and end it at Lu where they finally sink into the core and become chemically inactive. <i>Whereas</i> if you start it at La to create a Sc-Y-Lu table, you\'re creating a Ca\xe2\x80\x93Cu d-block situation, because you\'re starting the f-block with La with no 4f involvement except under extreme conditions and ending it at Yb where the 4f orbitals are <i>still</i> active. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 02:04, 12 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:R8R_Gtrs" class="mw-redirect" title="User:R8R Gtrs">R8R Gtrs</a>:</span> P.S. This argument <i>cannot</i> be used to "prove" that Al must be placed above Sc. In period 4, 3d first drops below 4s at Sc, so the d-block has to begin there. Therefore, if we are building up an 8-column table in the first three periods, we have to expand a new block and rip Mg apart from Al, so that Ca goes below Mg, Ga goes below Al, and the ten columns Sc\xe2\x80\x93Zn of the d-block go between them.</p>\n<p>Now, if we apply this to period 6, 5d first drops below 6s at La, so the d-block has to begin there. 4f does <i>not</i> drop below 5d and 6s at La; it does so at Ce. So the f-block has to begin there. Therefore, if we are building up an 18-column table in the first five periods, we have to expand a new block and rip La apart from Hf, so that La goes below Y, Hf goes below Zr, and the fourteen columns Ce\xe2\x80\x93Lu of the f-block go between them. The reason this argument is not applicable to Lu is that the facts just do not support it. This is not a matter of subjective opinion here: if you accept the principles of blocks as starting only when their subshell first becomes active, then we are drawn inexorably to the conclusion that La cannot be considered the first 4f-element as the 4f subshell is not yet active there. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 08:35, 13 November 2016 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Okay, point taken. I\'ll rephrase my original saying to, I think, more closely match my feeling about this: this is kind of question that relies on a) La being in group 3 and b) Lu not being in group 3. Both are relative; personally, I readily take a position that there\'s no such thing as an easy way out (as we\'re having this discussion in first place, as Sandbh mentioned he\'d changed his side three times, etc.). Therefore, I believe, to more or less convincingly point that group 3 is -La-Ac one must show that -La-Ac is a good fit in a way that -Lu-Lr isn\'t. In this argument, you do say -La-Ac is a fine fit but then you don\'t say how this excludes the possibility that -Lu-Lr is even better.</dd>\n<dd>All this said, I don\'t reject the whole idea; only this argument.--<a href="/wiki/User:R8R_Gtrs" class="mw-redirect" title="User:R8R Gtrs">R8R</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:R8R_Gtrs#top" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:R8R Gtrs">talk</a>) 18:29, 13 November 2016 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>As I\'ve said many times, if you use -La-Ac here, the f-block corresponds precisely to the filling of the f-orbitals, from their initial transition to activity at Ce and Th to their completion at Lu and Lr. If you use -Lu-Lr, then you start the f-block when the f-orbitals are not yet involved at La and Ac, and you end it early at Yb and No when it can still participate in chemistry and be ionised to a stable f<sup>13</sup> configuration. The former certainly looks better, especially since it looks closer to Sc\xe2\x80\x93Zn and Y\xe2\x80\x93Cd in the d-block (where as a -Lu-Lr group 3 gives an f-block that would be similar to a "d-block" consisting of Ca\xe2\x80\x93Cu and Sr\xe2\x80\x93Ag). So, I think that not only does this show that -La-Ac is "a fine fit" as you put it, but that -Lu-Lr is worse.</dd>\n<dd>(I must give credit to Lavelle\'s "pair out of place" argument here. He notes that since La is [Xe]5d<sup>1</sup>6s<sup>2</sup> and Ac is [Rn]6d<sup>1</sup>7s<sup>2</sup>, it would be the only example of a column in the f-block in which neither element had any f-electrons at all outside the previous noble gas core. What pushes it over for me is the total lack of any substantiation for 4f and 5f involvement in La and Ac respectively. I think he must have been thinking of that in how he insists that Th as [Rn]6d<sup>2</sup>7s<sup>2</sup> can still be placed in the f-block while Ac does not; while he looks inconsistent and was rightly scolded by Jensen for that, he is actually completely right if you consider condensed-phase configurations, where Th has fds hybridisations amounting to half a 5f electron on average, and consider the configuration of the Th<sup>3+</sup> cation, which is [Rn]5f<sup>1</sup> in the ground state. Contrast that to Ac whose valence band is purely (6d7s)<sup>3</sup> and for which Ac<sup>3+</sup> has the simple noble-gas configuration [Rn].)</dd>\n<dd>And yes, I agree that Sandbh and I have changed our sides on it way too many times (I think I started as -La-Ac, flip-flopped to -Lu-Lr after reading Jensen, back to -La-Ac after reading Greenwood, back to -Lu-Lr after reading Sandbh\'s summary, thought about it again when writing the La article, and went back to -La-Ac a few months ago). I do think this sort of argumentation based on what happens elsewhere in the periodic table can give a reasonably straightforward solution in favour of -La-Ac, of course if we agree that He remains above Ne and Be and Mg remain above Ca. The reason I didn\'t bring this up is that until the middle of this year, I do not think I actually ever went to think that deeply about what the principles of the periodic table as it is drawn actually are. (This is not an idle question, because I don\'t think they are actually ever explicitly officially stated.) <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 15:01, 14 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>"The books do it, and thus so should we" and "few people even care" are quite contradictory as the latter diminishes the intensity of the former.

No, they\'re saying "group 3 is Sc, Y, La, Ac", without acknowledging that there is any debate at all, acting as though the decision has already been made. (Maybe part of this is because the RSC and the ACS both use -La-Ac in their publications exclusively, unless of course the composition of group 3 is the subject under debate, which would explain the near-unanimity behind -La-Ac among English-speaking chemists. So you\'ll find that, while in general chemists may differ on why exactly they think -La-Ac is a superior presentation to -Lu-Lr, they will not differ for the most part in that conclusion.) <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 12:19, 30 October 2016 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>I unintendedly exaggerated, of course.

You can really feel the "someone-is-<i>wrong</i>" vibe in his article.

This is discussed in our <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> article. These configurations are for the metals in their gaseous form. It has recently been noted by Scerri, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rsc.org/blogs/eic/2015/08/chromium-electronic-configuration-half-filled-sub-shell">here</a> and in the articles he refers to there, that the electron configurations of the elements in their condensed (solid) phases are more pertinent to their chemistry.

I recall there was little controversy when the template was changed to Sc-Y-Lu-Lr. I\'d expect less controversy if the template was changed to the most popular form (together with updated explanatory text in the periodic table article). And I\'d support changing the 32-column table in our infobox to the 18-column form, as Double sharp has discussed elsewhere.</p>\n<p>I\'m inclined to not wait for the IUPAC task group. Articles change more or less continuously on Wikipedia, as new information comes to light. No doubt the same thing will happen when the IUPAC task group publishes their recommendation. If the Sc-Y-La-Ac form is currently the most popular form then that\'s the one that warrants appearing at the top of the article, unless better evidence suggests otherwise. <a href="/wiki/User:Sandbh" title="User:Sandbh">Sandbh</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sandbh" title="User talk:Sandbh">talk</a>) 11:02, 1 November 2016 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>The last para contains a reasonable notion. Why I argue it would be better to wait is that this discussion has become somewhat lengthy. If we agree to do the change now, and then IUPAC makes a different decision, I am more or less confident those who participated in <i>this</i> discussion and especially those among them who supported the change will be thinking that the arguments had been laid down and nothing would need to be changed. I am not confident that the discussion will be the same if we halt until then. That\'s my what I\'m worried about.</dd>\n<dd>In theory, we could do the change and agree now IUPAC won\'t matter whatever they decide. I, however, think it would be best to take in account their decision, which, as I have just described above, should be easier if we just wait.--<a href="/wiki/User:R8R_Gtrs" class="mw-redirect" title="User:R8R Gtrs">R8R</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:R8R_Gtrs#top" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:R8R Gtrs">talk</a>) 00:10, 17 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>I think common usage is commonly agreed to trump IUPAC on Wikipedia, which is why we have <a href="/wiki/Phosphine" title="Phosphine">phosphine</a> instead of phosphane. It\'s only when common usage is unclear or varies geographically (e.g. spelling of Al, S, and Cs; <a href="/wiki/Propene" title="Propene">propene</a> vs propylene) that we use IUPAC as a discussion-ender. Given that I\'ve never actually seen any reference work discussing the chemistry of the group 3 elements that includes Lu instead of La, I think the choice in favour of Sc-Y-La-Ac is clear even in the absence of all these arguments. If Sc-Y-Lu-Lr becomes more popular in future, we can revisit it then, but the way <a href="/wiki/Group_3_element" title="Group 3 element">group 3 element</a> is written (for example) is explicitly making the less popular form primary.

But, say, spellings of those elements are imposed on Wiki to a far greater extent than you would need (those spellings are not discussion-enders in a regular Wiki way, they are the standard to comply with in every case, even though we\'re doing fine without that in most situations). Such standardization is not needed and violates the spirit of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ENGVAR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ENGVAR">WP:ENGVAR</a>. This displays some, in my opinion, excessive reverence towards IUPAC in this part of Wiki. This makes me question if this is what they do in here?</dd>\n<dd>What I don\'t like about this whole discussion is that it does not try to begin with basics. Those who chose names for superheavy elements, for example, first set up the rules and only then went for it. I\'d want us, too, to define rules first and shift the focus of the discussion to that for now. You can be sure there will be people that would change the periodic table to the whatever form IUPAC chooses saying that they did it and we should follow.

For readability, I\'ll detail on lanthanides when needed, and just say \'and for actinides, <a href="/wiki/Mutatis_mutandis" title="Mutatis mutandis">mutatis mutandis</a>, the same\' or simply \'etc\'. IMO, these are the separate issues:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>1. <b>Show lanthanides and actinides</b> by using the IUPAC graph.</dd>\n<dd>2. Show the periodic table in <b>18- or 32-column?</b> The presentation form.</dd>\n<dd>3. <b>Which elements in group 3?</b> Options are: Sc/Y/Lu/Lr; Sc/Y/La/Ac; Sc/Y/*/* (=Sc, Y + all lanthanides and actinides = 32 elements). This is the scientific topic.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>RE 1: Wrong approach by the OP. The <i>table</i> structure (columns &amp; rows) does not exist to show the lanthanides etc. A table has columns (=groups) and rows (=periods). The PT also happens to have <i>blocks</i> showing (as an outcome of the physics, not as a setup). But lanthanides etc are a <i>category</i> (as we name that on this enwiki): the metallishness. All those categories are marked by <i>color</i>. So the lanthanides are shown by color. Simple: it would be impossible to adjust the table showing <a href="/wiki/Metalloid" title="Metalloid">metalloids</a> by column/row. I conclude: we shall not support this request.</p>\n<p>RE 2: Whatever the scientific statement made by a PT: the 18-col and the 32-col form <i>must</i> represent that same statement. One can not change group 3 when converting between those two, such a change is unacceptable. I conclude: 18- and 32-col are/must be equivalent in content. Prescribing one form (18 or 32 col) is wrong (and usually indicates a misinforming).</p>\n<p>RE 3: Between the scientific claims, this is actually the only real choice to be made in this RFC. I\'d say, of the three options Sc/Y/*/**, 32 elements, is outdated (it was popular &amp; common). The IUPAC team is still researching. We at enwiki can choose one as the preferred PT presentation, while describing the other two as wide as needed in relevant articles (as is done in the article <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a>). So far, I have no preference and I\'m interested (not an expert) in the discussions. That is, both the discussions via <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ELEMENTS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ELEMENTS">WP:ELEMENTS</a> and by the IUPAC-Scerri group. I conclude: (1) Sc/Y/*/** looks outdated; (2) between the two "group 3 = Sc/Y/?/?" options, we do need a <i>preferred</i> one (the one we\'ll use everywhere around enwiki), based on science.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>-<a href="/wiki/User:DePiep" title="User:DePiep">DePiep</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DePiep" title="User talk:DePiep">talk</a>) 00:56, 4 November 2016 (UTC)\n<ul>\n<li>I reread this RfC. I repeat my point: showing 18- or 32-column form is <i>independent</i> of the group 3 constitution to be shown. They are two unrelated choices. In other words, whatever group 3 is stated to contain (the <i>scientific statement</i>), both in 18- and 32-column <i>form</i> that statement must be shown correctly.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>- So, when going from 18 to 32 columns (or vice versa) that statement may not be changed. It is a graphic cut &amp; paste exercise only. For each scientific statement on group 3, there is a correct 18/32 <i>pair of PT graphs</i>.</dd>\n<dd>- Now, wrt group 3, <i>three</i> scientific statements are know: group 3 = Sc/Y/Lu/Lr, Sc/Y/La/Ac, and Sc/Y/*/** (the latter says under "3": group 3 has 32 elements). Those three are unambiguous, and mutually exclusive. Note that Sc/Y/*/** does <i>not</i> leave any ambivalence about group 3: it is a fixed listing too.</dd>\n<dd>- Together, that\'s 3 statements \xc3\x97 2 forms = 6 periodic tables (in three pairs).</dd>\n<dd>- This being about scientific statements, our description &amp; preference must be based on science. It may be unsolvable or 50/50, but hey don\'t blame the PT for it. If two (three?) claims are equally correct, it\'s up to us to solve that presentation question.

In general, as I read the GandE quote, this is an example of a triple mixup. We ordinary\'s classify lanthanides as a <i>category</i> (metallishness properties). [for actinides all similar; skipped for shortness]. But I understand that GandE says "La is not an lanthinide, because of not 4f filling" (that\'s the "0" in the <a href="#Tables">#Tables</a> no 2., right?). But IMO, "f-orbit filling" is just about <i>blocks</i> not categories. And since La is not filling the 4f shell, this only means La is <i>not in the f-block</i>. I assume La fills a d-shell, and so belongs in the d-block of the PT. Which is, right below Sc and Y (who are undisputed d-block members). IOW, GandE state that the group is the familiar Sc/Y/La[/Ac], into the d-block. Only awkward effect: in the graph, the d-block left-to-right is interrupted by the true f-block. Still, the f-block fits the pattern of a 2-period step (esp in Janets), and d-block a 4-period rectangle. Also, since our categories can freely spread and form in the PT (no group- or block borders to be followed eg metalloids), it is no problem to have the lanthanides color run into the d-block (Sc-column). GandE could have said: "La is not in the f-block". What\'s left to do after this is the conclusion about group 3. (The triple confusion is: block/category/group). -<a href="/wiki/User:DePiep" title="User:DePiep">DePiep</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DePiep" title="User talk:DePiep">talk</a>) 12:44, 22 November 2016 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Yes, what they are saying does not actually imply that La isn\'t a lanthanide (same for Ac), but rather that it isn\'t an f-block element (which, as you note, leads to a Sc-Y-La-Ac conclusion). You are indeed right about the electron configuration, where La is [Xe]5d<sup>1</sup>6s<sup>2</sup> and Ac is [Rn]6d<sup>1</sup>7s<sup>2</sup>, exactly following the smaller Y ([Kr]4d<sup>1</sup>5s<sup>2</sup>) and Sc ([Ar]3d<sup>1</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>). One should however note that we categorise the elements primarily based on their properties: elements are categorised in the same category for having common properties. In the case of lanthanum, the lack of f-electrons (f<sup>0</sup>) makes it qualitatively different from the other lanthanides, so that for example there is no 4f spin\xe2\x80\x93orbit coupling, no magnetic moment, and no fine structure in the bands of the La<sup>3+</sup> spectrum, so in that sense La appears as a bit of an outlier or degenerate case. (To be fair the same is true for Lu which is f<sup>14</sup>, but we have a precedent in the transition metals as we currently categorise them where the empty Ca with d<sup>0</sup> is not included but the full Zn with d<sup>10</sup> is.) Of course, this is a minority view nowadays; we will simply carry along as we have and use the IUPAC categorisation, where La is a lanthanide and Ac is an actinide. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 14:16, 22 November 2016 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>OK, clearer now. -<a href="/wiki/User:DePiep" title="User:DePiep">DePiep</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DePiep" title="User talk:DePiep">talk</a>) 18:33, 22 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n<dd>I think the hardest problem to overcome is that <i>old school</i> scientists have learned &amp; lived this old group 3 set of 32 elements without any problem \xe2\x80\x94 because it was not relevant.

I was wondering if you had an opinion on Sc-Y-La-Ac vs Sc-Y-Lu-Lr, since you hadn\'t expressed one. Or is either okay as long as we\'re consistent as a default, in your opinion? <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 08:23, 18 November 2016 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>TL;DR: Yes the wrong Sc/Y/*/** will have to disappear; I have no opinion between the other two; hope that Scerri concludes usefully (for our WP); and yes we can choose &amp; change earlier.</dd>\n<dd>0. No reply to that weird "La is not a lanthanide" claim by Greenwood etc above, is about category not group 3 (I hope).</dd>\n<dd>1. Yes, I expect Sc/Y/*/** will have to disappear, when Scerri concludes. Given Scerri\'s project remit, and also following this and similar discussions, few people claim group 3 to be Sc/Y/*/** (32 elem). e.g., even the IUPAC table we are talking about does not <i>source</i> it. Current proponents for this group 3 version I check on what they actually mean: easily it is confused with preferring the 18-col table format (which is unrelated to group 3) or about the LN and AN series (=category, not group). For examples, see this RfC lede and your (Ds) "2016 JWP report"above in this thread &amp; my 11:25 reply. So after Scerri reports I expect little reason to draw that 32-elements group 3 in PTs. Sure it should be described in history and background places. Actually it is quite special that the PT structure (a group) is being redefined, stating that the older version (say Seaborg 1940?) was <i>wrong</i>.</dd>\n<dd>2. Between Sc-Y-La-Ac vs Sc-Y-Lu-Lr I have no opinion. A preference should be pointed out on scientific base (sources). I\'m not that scientific enough, I can mostly follow but not argue with the reasonings. I object to arguments like "This one is as it was learned, the old habit, every scientist uses this one". Counting group 3 forms (in sources, schoolbooks, wallpapers) is not valid either: they picked a version that was not the outcome of a scientific debate (so far), or drew the group 3 sloppy (squeezing in the asterisks somewhere). And anyway, old and current books mostly use the <s>32-element group 3</s>. The only PTs worth counting as a vote are those where that source <i>bases</i> its group 3 on arguments (ie the publication is stating &amp; sourcing group 3). A bit like the <a href="/wiki/List_of_metalloid_lists" class="mw-redirect" title="List of metalloid lists">metalloid lists</a> starts.</dd>\n<dd>3. For this encyclopedia, I hope that Scerri c.s. concludes a clear preference between the two. Of course we shall describe both (plus the old wrong one) in some articles. But as the ubiquitous boilerplate PT when discussing say (unrelated to group 3) halogens: we use that preferred version (either in 18 or 32 col, is an unrelated choice). But if Scerri ends with a 50/50 preference, it is up to us to decide and by which WP-grounds (educational ones? RfC voting?). And maybe Scerri could conclude to prefer that crippled version (not-continuous atomic numbers). Well, these are only a problem after Scerri publishes.</dd>\n<dd>4. Earlier choice? OK with me. We already have a preferred version (as article <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> says: Sc/Y/Lu/Lr). I\'m fine with a change into Sc/Y/La/Ac as you discuss here. Even by more relaxed criteria as source-counting and -weighing, because <i>that</i> is reflecting the <i>current state in science</i> we must &amp; should follow to publish. And it is only some months until Scerri publishes. For this early version too: better one for all those WP PTs. -<a href="/wiki/User:DePiep" title="User:DePiep">DePiep</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:DePiep" title="User talk:DePiep">talk</a>) 11:39, 18 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>todo</dt>\n</dl>\n<p>In <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table" title="Periodic table">Periodic table</a>, sections <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table#Group_3_constitution_variants" title="Periodic table">#Group 3 constitution variants</a> and <a href="/wiki/Periodic_table#Period_6_and_7_elements_in_group_3" title="Periodic table">#Period 6 and 7 elements in group 3</a> overlap.

So the only two possible outcomes of this RFC as I see it are: (1) keep the current configuration and apply it consistently, harmonising 32- and 18-column tables, including marking Lu and Lr as group 3 members in the infoboxes, etc.; (2) switch to Sc-Y-La-Ac and apply <i>that</i> consistently, harmonising 32- and 18-column tables, including marking La and Ac as group 3 members in the infoboxes, etc. Whatever we do, La/Lu (and Ac/Lr) will still be classified as lanthanides (and actinides), so it is only their spatial position that is in question. <a href="/wiki/User:Double_sharp" title="User:Double sharp">Double sharp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Double_sharp" title="User talk:Double sharp">talk</a>) 08:27, 18 November 2016 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Silvio73.27s_comments">Silvio73\'s comments</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Periodic_table&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Silvio73\'s comments">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>From a Wikipedia\'s approach IUPAC is just one of the sources and unless it is not dediced that IUPAC is prominent against other sources, I don\'t see why it should be preferred, although I noticed that in some instances WP has preferred to use IUPAC definitions even when alternative are more common (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Propene" title="Propene">propene</a> instead of <a href="/wiki/Propylene" class="mw-redirect" title="Propylene">propylene</a>). However, I just checked on three books at home.

Nevertheless, IUPAC template is somehow in discontinuity with the historical arguments from which the periodic table stems, namely but nor limited to the homogeneity of physical and chemical properties of the elements across the same group (please note that La and Ac have very similar properties). Somehow, the IUPAC template suggest the group III has 32 elements and not 4 (as all other d-block elements). <b>My preference would be therefore for the Sc-Y-La-Ac template.</b> <a href="/wiki/User:Silvio1973" title="User:Silvio1973">Silvio1973</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Silvio1973" title="User talk:Silvio1973">talk</a>) 09:32, 17 November 2016 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>"It looks IUPAC propose a different template ...": I don\'t understand.
