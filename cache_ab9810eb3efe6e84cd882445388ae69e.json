However, I\'m unable to convince the other editor. The related discussion can be found here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/wiki/Talk:Ernst_Lindemann#Neo-Nazi_publication" title="Talk:Ernst Lindemann">Talk:Ernst Lindemann#Neo-Nazi publication</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have notified the other editor here: <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADapi89&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=773173510&amp;oldid=773110391">diff</a>.<a href="/wiki/User:K.e.coffman" title="User:K.e.coffman">K.e.coffman</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:K.e.coffman" title="User talk:K.e.coffman">talk</a>) 19:37, 31 March 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>This individual has tried to label all books published by this house as Neo-Nazi, without offering a shred of evidence the authors are engaged in this kind thing. This latest round is symptomatic of his behaviour. His attacks on the German-related articles, specifically related to World War II, looks like a crusade. I am pleased that a score of other editors have helped rebuff his attempts to project his own views on to these articles. The fact that he will dispute such a small (but not trivial) detail is typical of his unhelpful and destructive "contributions". <a href="/wiki/User:Dapi89" title="User:Dapi89">Dapi89</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dapi89" title="User talk:Dapi89">talk</a>) 19:50, 31 March 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>Let\'s not turn this discussion into personal attacks, shall we?

I consider this information to be superfluous (along with editor <a href="/wiki/User:Ian_Rose" title="User:Ian Rose">Ian Rose</a> who has commented on Talk), and I\'m seeking third party input on the matter. <a href="/wiki/User:K.e.coffman" title="User:K.e.coffman">K.e.coffman</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:K.e.coffman" title="User talk:K.e.coffman">talk</a>) 02:03, 1 April 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>I see a couple of questions here, one is sourcing, and one is inclusion. A quick glance seems to indicate that the source is a published book, presumably not a self-published book, and probably meets wp:rs criteria. More to the point is whether the statement of receipt the award is wp:sourcable.

We note that a person graduated 286 in a class of 500, is that any less relevant? This is part of a larger "crusade", I suspect, to discredit a series of articles about military personnel in WWII in Germany. The service of Germans in their country\'s war is a fact. The award of medals is a fact. This are not alternative facts, regardless of who publishes the information.

And I don\'t understand a few of the comments in this last section--"So if a recipient of an award was 94th, so what?" doesn\'t make a lot of sense after it was stated that the information is "at least as important" as the person\'s service. And that someone graduated 286 in a class of 500, I have never seen that noted in an article, though I grant that I don\'t MilHist much. Anyway, I\'ve seen K.e.coffman\'s work, and I have never had a reason to doubt their good intentions; I would appreciate it if you all could drop the "crusade" language, since it only discredits the person using the term. <a href="/wiki/User:Drmies" title="User:Drmies">Drmies</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Drmies" title="User talk:Drmies">talk</a>) 15:59, 11 April 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>The \'so what\' I believe is in reference to it being an uncontentious piece of information. The fact he is recipient of the award is not in doubt, Coffman however is saying the sourcing provided is not reliable to state the fact that he was the \'94\' recipient. Ultimately unless you are the first or last recipient of almost all awards, you are just a link in the chain of winners, so it really is not important if they were 94th, 95th, 105th etc. If the fact of the award is not disputed, I have not seen any evidence above the source is not reliable to say they were the 94th. If they are a right-wing publisher, then you can expect them to have done some research on right-wing figures. Its not beyond the realms of feasibility they might puff up subjects *where there is a benefit in doing so*. I cant see any reason it would be biased or romanticising to say "Subject X was the 94th recipient of award Y" over "Subject X was the recipient of award Y". Where is the motivation? If people are going to argue a source\'s political stance influences their reliability, you need to actually make a credible argument there is a *reason* for them to publish unreliable material. <a href="/wiki/User:Only_in_death" title="User:Only in death">Only in death does duty end</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Only_in_death" title="User talk:Only in death">talk</a>) 16:29, 11 April 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>I don\'t dispute your statement, <a href="/wiki/User:Only_in_death" title="User:Only in death">User:Only in death</a>--and at any rate, the rank is not the most important matter.

It\'s biased to the extreme (Range uses peacock words to describe Lindemann in nearly every sentence: <i>vorbildlich, besonnen, erfolgreich</i> = exemplary, considerate, successful) and it does not contain much information anyway. I cannot imagine that a historian would refer to that work while writing about Lindemann. The same information, that he was the 94th recipient, could easily be referenced with Manfred D\xc3\xb6rr (1996), <i>Ritterkreuztr\xc3\xa4ger der \xc3\x9cberwasserstreitkr\xc3\xa4fte</i>, vol. 2, already being used in the article. So, as was pointed out very early on, one question is sourcing, the other inclusion. The first could be resolved quickly, although I am not sure, if there isn\'t an interest to keep Range as a source anyway. The second touches upon <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DUE">WP:DUE</a>. These kind of articles, i.e. articles dealing with Knight\'s Cross recipients, are stuffed with small details. Those details lend authenticity to a narrative which actually distracts from the violence of war. The article features a whole chapter on the <i>Knight\'s Cross of the Iron Cross</i>, but skips over the fact that L\xc3\xbctjens and Lindemann, following Erich Raeder\'s order, were responsible for the hopeless final fight and thus for the death of most of their crew. (Holger Afflerbach: <i>"Mit wehender Fahne untergehen"</i>. In: <i>VfZ</i> 49 (2001), p. 609.) Sure, that\'s the usual German military glory stuff of Wikipedia. But if "romancing" is to be critically discussed at some point, it has to include a discussion of how "facts" are selected and how they are presented.

Some editors may not fully understand the consequences of such bias in the encyclopedia: #1 - America is divided almost equally but Trump won and there\'s a Republican majority in both the House and Senate so NPOV is just as important now as it was from 2008-2016; and #2 - world leaders are showing more respect for Trump than left-leaning MSM, whose primary goal is $$$ generated by bait-click now that print is outdated.

Journalism today barely resembles journalism from 10 years or even 5 years ago. They\'re just running with "stories" and all rushing to get their click-bait articles published so quickly that they keep forgetting to make sure the stories are true or are properly sourced. The basic tenets of journalism are completely out of the window. And that\'s why we\'re sitting here with endless "RS" (which pretty much means only NYT, WaPo, Vox, BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, ABC News, CBS News and other organizations that popped up in last year\'s WikiLeaks bombshells again and again) reporting primarily one point of view, with no distinction between hard news and opinion commentary at all.

But the current press is being negative/critical without retaining objectivity, in part to many many factors (loss of finances, loss of readership to citizen journalism, competition of opinionated journalism from conservative media like Fox News, timeliness of reporting against social media\'s speed, the culture war, etc.) all which were happening to a lesser degree before Trump too office - his presence intensified it. And its not about "balance", it is about impartiality and tone. The net result, as here in the election article, is that predominate editors around the article are writing from the media\'s stance that has already declared Russia guilty, so any shred of evidence that the media jumps on (like the Trump Jr. meeting) that supports that <i>must</i> be inserted immediately, when instead we should be holding off for a few <i>years</i> to be writing anything more indepth, and if not that, staying very impartial to the matter and document the controversy rather than then trying to push analysis of it. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 13:08, 27 July 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Well, I agree that many editors tend jump on new events too quickly. That could be bias \xe2\x80\x93 but could also simply be an overly eager desire to keep WP up-to-date without heeding RECENTISM. But, I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with a broad indictment of the press, or that we should somehow assume bias and filter out this perceived bias, simply because coverage is negative. Perhaps there is good reason that the coverage is negative. Real-life politics appears to focus more and more on the negative these days. In any case, this sounds more like a general argument on policy; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is the correct venue. <a href="/wiki/User:Objective3000" title="User:Objective3000">Objective3000</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Objective3000" title="User talk:Objective3000">talk</a>) 13:22, 27 July 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>I may be missing something obvious, but do the cited sources actually support the sentence in the article? The Politico article cannot be used as a source that "The Trump administration responded by citing a January 2017 <i><a href="/wiki/Politico" title="Politico">Politico</a></i> report..." and the suggestion to look at the Ukrainian influence originates with Hannity, not the Trump administration, according to the Politifact article. I am very skeptical if Hannity\'s opinions are due weight, and they certainly should not be presented as if they had the weight of the White House. In any case, both the Politico and Politifact reports present the story\'s connection to Russian influence as a <a href="/wiki/False_equivalence" title="False equivalence">false equivalence</a> anyway. So, while it could conceivably be mentioned, it should be done so with considerably more attention to what these reliable sources actually say about it. I feel like <i>that</i> would probably be undue weight on something that is only of peripheral relevance to the article, unless there is considerably more attention (e.g., White House response, DNC response, and further news analysis). <a href="/wiki/User:S%C5%82awomir_Bia%C5%82y" title="User:S\xc5\x82awomir Bia\xc5\x82y"><span style="text-shadow:grey 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em; class=texhtml">S\xc5\x82awomir Bia\xc5\x82y</span></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:S%C5%82awomir_Bia%C5%82y" title="User talk:S\xc5\x82awomir Bia\xc5\x82y">talk</a>) 12:45, 27 July 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There\'s a reason for the electoral college in the US - our Founding Fathers had enough foresight to see that the electoral college would help preserve liberty and justice for ALL via a fair election process unlike socialism/communism which excludes the fundamental rights of an individual and favors the collective (and that works as long as you\'re not that individual). Back on point, <a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">Masem</a>, <a href="/wiki/User:JFG" title="User:JFG">JFG</a>, it appears to me that the final determination of what is or isn\'t NPOV will be made by whatever coordinated group happens to be protesting the loudest at the time. In the interim, we are all required to AGF, and like good little volunteers, be compliant with PAGs that are considered to be antiquated and highly ambiguous...but what do we know? It\'s ok if MSM drags out the Russian conspiracy theories with their bait-click revenue schemes, but it\'s not ok to mention Clinton\'s deals with the Russians or the money the Clinton Global Initiative was receiving from foreign governments, or any other incident that tarnishes their reputation. It\'s ok for MSM to accuse Scaramucci of wrong doing, which resulted in the firing of 3 CNN employees, but WP editors must still consider CNN &amp; Politico as RS. They don\'t publish conspiracy theories - they publish reliable information - only FOXNews and conservative media publishes conspiracy theories, right? It\'s no secret that WP suffers from systemic biases, be it gender, religion, or politics - after all, MSM said so. We are also aware that the encyclopedia is plagued by those editors who are here for one purpose, anonymity allows it and provides the perfect platform from which they are able to push a particular POV - be it the result of paid editing or advocacy - both being hazardous to the health of the project in much the same way business promotion is hazardous.. Unfortunately, the concern has not risen to a level of urgency which appears to be the only motivator of change, although it appears WFM has to agreed to ACTRIAL, so we\'re moving in the right direction. Another positive step would be the breaking news moratorium we\'ve been discussing on EEng\'s TP. I\'m still not sure how to combat the kind of bias that allows, for example, <a href="/wiki/Sean_Hannity" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a> to be called a "conspiracy theorist" in WP voice (based on what rival pundits in MSM have called him) but not <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Maddow" title="Rachel Maddow">Rachel Maddow</a> for the same reasons. The excuse for the reverts (while an "in use" template is still attached) is BLP violation. I guess Hannity is not a BLP in the eyes of some editors. I\'m still trying to figure that one out, and looking for the best solution that is actually compliant with NPOV since that isn\'t what I\'m seeing at those two articles now. I\'ve often wondered if any consideration is given to the fact that FOXNews leads the ratings and is a very powerful voice in MSM because of their "fair and balanced approach". Based on MSM reporting (and ratings), FOXNews is clearly the popular choice...but wait...to equal their ratings, you have to add MSNBC &amp; CNN together (discounting their occasional spikes based on...uhm, conspiracy theories) to equal that of FOXNews. Sounds like popular vote vs electoral college, doesn\'t it? I\'ve lost count of how many times FOX has been discredited as an unreliable source, along with Breitbart, The Daily Caller, The National Review, etc...for no other reason other than their "conservative POV". There isn\'t one publication in MSM that hasn\'t had to make a retraction at one time or other so I guess it\'s one of those "make-up the rules as you go along" scenarios. NPOV means inclusion of relevant views that can be cited to RS. I also keep seeing <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> used when a particular narrative doesn\'t fit a left leaning POV - uhm, what gives a leftist view the edge over a conservative view? I could understand it when the left dominated the House, Senate and presidency, but guess what? That is no longer the case, so when we mention UNDUE, who makes that determination? And that\'s when bias rears its ugly head and is the basis for the determination that Maddow is not a conspiracy theorist but Hannity is, and so it shall be. smh Time will tell. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/05/31/tech-billionaires-like-democrats-more-than-republicans-heres-why/?utm_term=.6b772b974c85">This is an intersting read</a> if you have time.<sup><a href="/wiki/User:Atsme" title="User:Atsme"><font style="text-shadow:#F8F8FF 0.2em 0.2em 0.4em,#F4BBFF -0.2em -0.3em 0.6em,#BFFF00 0.8em 0.8em 0.6em;color:#A2006D">Atsme</font></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Atsme" title="User talk:Atsme">\xf0\x9f\x93\x9e</a><a href="/wiki/Special:EmailUser/Atsme" title="Special:EmailUser/Atsme">\xf0\x9f\x93\xa7</a></sup> 13:05, 27 July 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Such naked nationalist rhetoric and offtopic rants against "MSM" has no place at the neutral point of view noticeboard.

Here\'s what I said in the talk page: "I think this article needs some of its content from the section on controversy moved to a new section called criticism, with additional details. This person has been criticized by many notable public figures, including Sam Harris and Courtney Love. Additionally, the tone of the whole article seems very defensive, and it needs a review by a senior editor. On the talk page, too, at least two editors seem to have personal connections with this person who are refusing to consider or are outright twisting criticism by others."</p>\n<p>My comment on the two editors was based purely on my reading of the talk page, where multiple people have raised similar issues. The article appears to be guarded to make sure no negative perception of its subject is formed (for instance, every time potentially damaging fact is mentioned, it instantly follows with an explanation, as if this was a newspaper).</p>\n<p>When I raised my objection, one of the two editors I mention attacked me and threatened me with sanctions and sent me a notice. This seems like a misuse of their privilege, because I am clearly not interested in vandalism. I have made many substantial contributions to various wiki pages.

Not much more than local coverage (the NYTmes article is the local section) and the sole claim is that she chaired a non-bluelinked, local group. Article at that point might easily have been deleted. Sarsour sprang to notability as an "organizer" of the <a href="/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March" title="2017 Women\'s March">2017 Women\'s March</a>. Leaving aside the fact that the question of who merits being called an "organizer" of that march if a controversial question in its own right, this was her first moment of fame, and, as with all of her subsequent news cycle appearances, the coverage centered she was or was not in favor of shaaria and terrorism, and on whether she was or was not anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, anti-LGBT, and anti-feminism. there was a lot of coverage <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22linda+sarsour%22+%22women%27s+March%22&amp;safe=active&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKu8WP6KTVAhWBCT4KHV8qCdgQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1853&amp;bih=1026">[12]</a>, and do note (I was involved in editing the Women\'s march article last winter) that other members of the "organizing committee" that she was part of are not blue-linked. Controversy over her stand on thse issues pretty much constitutes her notability, generating articles that defend or accuse her on each of these issue (I may have missed an issue or two, there is, for example, some controversy within the Muslim community regarding her authenticity as a spokesperson for Islam or Muslim Americans.) Given this reality, I suggest not only that it is reasonable for the article to have sections on <i>Views</i>, where her articulate positions have garnered significant coverage, (much as we do with politicians,) but also that despite my general disparagement of "controversies" sections, when an individual is, in fact, notable primarily for repeatedly saying stuff on twitter and elsewhere that generates nationwide coverage it seems to be reasonable to cover them in a "controversy" section. ping me if you have a better proposal.<a href="/wiki/User:E.M.Gregory" title="User:E.M.Gregory">E.M.Gregory</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:E.M.Gregory" title="User talk:E.M.Gregory">talk</a>) 16:24, 25 July 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:E.M.Gregory" title="User:E.M.Gregory">E.M.Gregory</a>:</span> The article does actually have a "controversies" section, because you\'re right, in this case it\'s a relatively neutral way of covering the issue. <a href="/wiki/User:NorthBySouthBaranof" title="User:NorthBySouthBaranof">NorthBySouthBaranof</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:NorthBySouthBaranof" title="User talk:NorthBySouthBaranof">talk</a>) 16:43, 25 July 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>Anyone who advocates for Palestinians will attract a lot of Islamophobic opposition.

Also, we cannot just summarily state that "black supremacy" denotes de facto racism because it shares the word supremacy with "white supremacy".

The person, last name \'Thomas\' wrote publicly on a youtube website (Democracy Now) at that time, "I found your Wiki page, unless you want it marked with a million citations needed by tomorrow, you will retract your insult to me."</p>\n<p>Today as promised, were demands for citation on virtually every sentence of the article about the artists work, by user: Sg Thomas - same last name as the individual threatening to harass in this manner. Citations demanded by Sg Thomas included date of birth, repetitious demands where clear and well researched citations exist elsewhere in the paragraph or section, etc. Something like 30 frivolous demands, in this way. And when attempting to undo the changes by this individual, received messages in talk like \'I can do this all day\', and now see attempts by this user to see the article removed.</p>\n<p>The obtuse manner of the behavior, coupled with the exacting threat the day earlier, make it clearly an act of harassment and intimidation by this user, however professional they attempt to make their behavior appear in view of others who would inspect.</p>\n<p>To be clear, one is not against adding citations where truly needed. And this article is well researched by several users over a period of years. The user is flagging the article for COI today, but at no point does it promote a product for sale, or point to an outside website or company. It is biographical, and full of reliable (journalistic) citations in each paragraph, and is used by journalists and students over years before this, without incident.</p>\n<p>What can be done, in such a case where a user like Sg Thomas uses Wikipedia, and threats of seeing articles removed, as a form of harassment and intimidation over unrelated matters in this way? When attempting to file a complaint elsewhere on Wiki, we received the message \'Citations are not vandalism\', but what we are reporting here, is harassment and intimidation, for reasons which are not truly legitimate.</p>\n<p>Any help in combating this behavior would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for your attention. <small class="autosigned">\xe2\x80\x94&#160;Preceding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="/wiki/User:MusicEditor1234" title="User:MusicEditor1234">MusicEditor1234</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:MusicEditor1234#top" title="User talk:MusicEditor1234">talk</a> \xe2\x80\xa2 <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/MusicEditor1234" title="Special:Contributions/MusicEditor1234">contribs</a>) 22:31, 16 August 2017 (UTC)</small></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The edits have been reverted, so this may not be a big deal.

Editor A says "Hey man I\'m just using the label from RSes, and no you\'re not allowed to use any other label.". Editor B says "Okay whatever let\'s just not put a label then please.". Editor A says "No you can\'t take the spicy label out just because you don\'t like it, that would be original research.". Tempers rise because editor B believes editor A is just inserting the spicy label in order to make Bob Smith look bad, and that the RSes are biased. Editor A thinks editor B is a Smith-ist sympathiser trying to cover for Bob Smith.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If Bob Smith is reliably and widely reported to be a convicted criminal, when is it appropriate to refer to him as "convicted criminal <a href="/wiki/Bob_Smith" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="Bob Smith">Bob Smith</a>". I don\'t like him very much, can I go all over wikipedia and put \'convicted criminal\' next to his wikilink every time he is mentioned? What about when all the news stories say "alleged rapist"?</li>\n<li>When journalists as a whole decide to condemn Bob Smith, there is little to stop them from using sensationalising labels. And in fact a good news editor will encourage this sort of language. Is it encyclopedic to simply repeat these labels, or does that bias the encyclopedia towards sensationalist and condemnative language?</li>\n<li>The most inflaming cases appear when the label describes an ideology or belief that Bob Smith denies. Obviously nobody, not even the journalist, is qualified to read their mind. This gets even worse when the label is vague or evolving in meaning (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Alt-right" title="Alt-right">alt-right</a>), since the journo may not even intend all the consequences of the label as stated on the label\'s article.

In-text attribution is awkward and gets rarely used, especially not in article leads. I\'m not here to make the usual complaint of \'left wing bias\' or whatever ...

The problem with that RfC is that it is an ultimatum - if the subject denies the label, it cannot be used. It seems to make an exception for terrorists, which only denounces the problem with the proposal; opposing editors mention the rejection of other labels as an issue, as such labels may have a negative connotation and the people that are labeled with them may refuse them merely to not look bad, even if they were rightly labeled so and no one besides them questions the label. In that case not labeling them just because they refuse the label would be wrong. Their refusal should however be noted, right after the first labeling. <span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, \'DejaVu Serif\', serif; color: #008560;">When journalists as a whole decide to condemn Bob Smith ...

When a label should be used, how to present that label (eg attribution), and, in the label is determined to be appropriate, <i>when</i> to use that label. More often than not, the latest issues arise because some editors want to stuff labels into the opening sentence of an article, even if it is one that is deemed appropriate to include somewhere, as that sets a non-partial tone for an article as well. There\'s a lot of questions that all need to be answered at the same time, and more often than not, only the first of these is of focus. --<a href="/wiki/User:Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 20:04, 20 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>As an example of why all three are important, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://variety.com/2017/film/people-news/jerry-lewis-dies-dead-nutty-professor-1202533899">here is Variety\'s obit for Jerry Lewis</a>, which in its <b>fourth paragraph</b> (effectively its lede) it slams his political views, and thus immediately sets a tone for the entire article.

Any label that is both subjective and could be deemed to be controversial should be properly attributed and should not be given equal status to objective labels or to non-controversial subjective labels. For a BLP, if the subject is shown through sources to have disagreed with a subjective label, then that label should be deemed controversial. Anything with "alleged" / "accused" / "claimed" etc., next to it as qualifiers is controversial. A subjective label, controversial or not, should never be worded as if it is an incontrovertible fact - it should be made clear it is an opinion expressed in some rs sources. Subjective labels, controversial or not, should not appear in the first sentence of a BLP lead. Subjective labels would be things like political labels going beyond party allegiances, sociological labels, societal labels, labels used by select groups or holders of select ideologies, labels used by the subject as a self-description, insults, labels related to intelligence, labels implying biases, etc. Objective labels would be things like citizenship or age or profession or career qualifications or membership of political bodies or - unless exceptional reasons occur - criminal convictions if convicted in a court of law in a democratic country, etc. Labels should not be stand-alone content - a label has to be justified by the article having content related to that label - so for example, if there is nothing to do with religion in a person\'s article, that person should not be labeled Christian or Muslim or Jewish. Ideally, editors would be forbidden from stating "xxx is yyy" in the first sentence of a lead if label yyy is subjective, and editors would be forbidden from creating content that states, without qualifying wording such as attribution, that "xxx is yyy" if label yyy is both subjective and controversial. Attribution qualifying wording would require more than just giving a ref after the label. I think none of this means excluding sourced content, it is just giving content appropriate weight. <a href="/wiki/User:Tiptoethrutheminefield" title="User:Tiptoethrutheminefield">Tiptoethrutheminefield</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Tiptoethrutheminefield" title="User talk:Tiptoethrutheminefield">talk</a>) 22:02, 20 August 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Nanite" title="User:Nanite">Nanite</a>, I agree that journalists frequently use "spicy" labels for people.

Bannon has perhaps more than any other person in U.S. politics made divisive statements and attracted controversy and condemnation in mainstream sources.

That someone thinks he\'s a racist? The text of the article should make those things clear, in more balanced terms than one single photo.

None of the many dozens of photos on the <a href="/wiki/Hillary_Clinton" title="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> articles are of protests against them. One single one on the <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> article is of a protest, out of dozens. If the new standard is "if there\'s controversy mentioned in the article body, we can have a photo of a protest sign accusing the article subject", then what\'s to prevent one single editor from going on lots of demos against political figures they don\'t like and uploading the photos they take, thus significantly skewing the content?

And arguably for either Bill Clinton or Obama, if there were protests over their Presidency, I would probably expect to see that on something like <a href="/wiki/Political_positions_of_Barack_Obama" title="Political positions of Barack Obama">Political positions of Barack Obama</a> or <a href="/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2016" title="Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016">Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016</a>. Since Bannon\'s never run for office, there\'s not going to be those separate articles. Additionally, given how much public dislike of him (and documentation to that effect), in contrast with the three above, it seems completely reasonable.
