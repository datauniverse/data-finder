are to be <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles (FAs)</a>. FAs exemplify Wikipedia\'s very best work and satisfy the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Featured article criteria">FA criteria</a>. All editors are welcome to review nominations; please see the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches">review FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>Before nominating an article, nominators may wish to receive feedback by listing it at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">peer review</a>. Editors considering their first nomination, and any subsequent nomination before their first FA promotion, are <b>strongly advised</b> to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Mentoring_for_FAC" title="Wikipedia:Mentoring for FAC">seek the involvement of a mentor</a>, to assist in the preparation and processing of the nomination. Nominators must be sufficiently familiar with the subject matter and sources to deal with objections during the featured article candidates (FAC) process. Nominators who are not <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://vs.aka-online.de/wppagehiststat/">significant contributors to the article</a> should consult regular editors of the article before nominating it. Nominators are expected to respond positively to constructive criticism and to make efforts to address objections promptly. An article should not be on Featured article candidates and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PR">Peer review</a> or <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:GAN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:GAN">Good article nominations</a> at the same time.</p>\n<p>The FAC coordinators\xe2\x80\x94<a href="/wiki/User:Ian_Rose" title="User:Ian Rose">Ian Rose</a> and <a href="/wiki/User:Sarastro1" title="User:Sarastro1">Sarastro1</a>\xe2\x80\x94determine the timing of the process for each nomination. For a nomination to be <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/August_2017" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/August 2017">promoted</a> to FA status, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> must be reached that it meets the criteria. Consensus is built among reviewers and nominators; the coordinators determine whether there is consensus. A nomination will be removed from the list and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Archived_nominations/August_2017" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Archived nominations/August 2017">archived</a> if, in the judgment of the coordinators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>actionable objections have not been resolved;</li>\n<li>consensus for promotion has not been reached;</li>\n<li>insufficient information has been provided by reviewers to judge whether the criteria have been met; or</li>\n<li>a nomination is unprepared, after at least one reviewer has suggested it be withdrawn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is assumed that all nominations have good qualities; this is why the main thrust of the process is to generate and resolve <i>critical</i> comments in relation to the criteria, and why such resolution is given considerably more weight than declarations of support.</p>\n<p>The use of graphics or templates on FAC nomination pages is discouraged, including graphics such as {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Done" title="Template:Done">done</a>}}, {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Not_done" title="Template:Not done">not done</a>}} and {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Xt" title="Template:Xt">xt</a>}}: they slow down the page load time and lead to errors in the FAC archives.</p>\n<p>An editor is allowed to be the sole nominator of only one article at a time; however, two nominations may be allowed if the editor is a co-nominator on at least one of them. If a nomination is archived, the nominator(s) should take adequate time to work on resolving issues before re-nominating. None of the nominators may nominate or co-nominate any article for two weeks unless given leave to do so by a coordinator; if such an article is nominated without asking for leave, a coordinator will decide whether to remove it. Nominators whose nominations are archived with no (or minimal) feedback will be given exemptions.</p>\n<p>To contact the FAC coordinators, please leave a message on the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates">FAC talk page</a>, or use the {{<a href="/wiki/Template:@FAC" title="Template:@FAC">@FAC</a>}} <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Notifications" title="Wikipedia:Notifications">notification</a> template elsewhere.</p>\n<p>A <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/archiving" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/archiving">bot will update the article talk page</a> after the article is promoted or the nomination archived;

Each objection must provide <b>a specific rationale that can be addressed</b>. If nothing can be done in principle to address the objection, the coordinators may ignore it. References on style and grammar do not always agree; if a contributor cites support for a certain style in a standard reference work or other authoritative source, reviewers should consider accepting it. Reviewers who object are strongly encouraged to return after a few days to check whether their objection has been addressed. To withdraw the objection, strike it out (with <code>&lt;s&gt; ... &lt;/s&gt;</code>) rather than removing it.

The WTRF article\'s caption may not be the best example I\'ve ever done, but I guess I was aiming to use the sound clip to give the reader a better understanding of what the "blistering" and "rollicking" descriptions in the article actually sound like in the song. If you feel my approach is valid, do you have a suggestion for details (ideally descriptions from the article or paraphrases of them) that you would like to see in the caption instead of "blistering" and "rollicking"?

I\'ve mostly treated samples (and images) as examples of the general subject and not a particular aspect of it. That way they may be used to illustrate a variety of points, such as "guitar figure", "first verse", "chorus", etc., as the editor may choose. If you wish to use it to show what a writer is describing, perhaps the caption should be attributed, e.g., "Excerpt of "blistering guitar" and "rollicking piano" as described by critic Anthony Varesi[17]". Otherwise, the caption should be more neutral.

But I am certainly open to changing the photo. One idea is I could change it to a pic of Dylan in concert. I\'ll check to see whether I might be lucky enough that a Wiki Commons photo exists for one of the 500 concerts where Dylan played WTRF\xe2\x80\x94in that case the photo caption would take care of itself. If such a photo doesn\'t exist, let\'s discuss whether a generic live photo of Dylan would be better than current Wyman one, and if so what an appropriate caption would be.

This article is about an episode of the American <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television" title="Science fiction on television">science fiction television</a> series <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager" title="Star Trek: Voyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></i>. It is the third episode of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek:_Voyager_episodes" title="List of Star Trek: Voyager episodes">sixth season</a> and was first broadcast by <a href="/wiki/UPN" title="UPN">UPN</a> on October 6, 1999.&#160;In this episode, the half-<a href="/wiki/Klingon" title="Klingon">Klingon</a>, half-human <a href="/wiki/B%27Elanna_Torres" title="B\'Elanna Torres">B\'Elanna Torres</a> (<a href="/wiki/Roxann_Dawson" title="Roxann Dawson">Roxann Dawson</a>) has a <a href="/wiki/Near-death_experience" title="Near-death experience">near-death experience</a> and is sent to the Klingon version of <a href="/wiki/Hell" title="Hell">Hell</a> known as <a href="/wiki/Gre%27Thor" class="mw-redirect" title="Gre\'Thor">Gre\'thor</a>. There she encounters her mother Miral (<a href="/wiki/Karen_Austin" title="Karen Austin">Karen Austin</a>), who is damned because of Torres\' refusal to fully accept her identity as a Klingon. After being resuscitated by the <i>Voyager</i> crew, Torres becomes intent on revisiting Gre\'thor to save her mother.</p>\n<p>Moore originally developed the episode as part of a pitch for the <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" title="Star Trek: Deep Space Nine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></i> episode "<a href="/wiki/Soldiers_of_the_Empire" title="Soldiers of the Empire">Soldiers of the Empire</a>". Following the episode\'s completion, both Moore and Fuller left the series because of dissatisfaction with their lack of control over its direction, and the absence of strong story arcs across multiple episodes. Critical response to the episode was mixed; some <a href="/wiki/Television_criticism" title="Television criticism">television critics</a> praised the focus on Torres and Dawson\'s performance, while others were more critical of the representation of Klingon spirituality.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed working on this article; I found the premise for this episode to be really interesting as I always like bizarre character studies, even if the final result was not so great. I believe that it satisfies all of the FA criteria. I look forward to hearing your feedback and growing as a writer and a Wikipedia contributor.

I have only included one screenshot in an episode article in the past as there was a lot of critical and cast commentary on that particular moment to warrant a non-free resource. For instance, if there was a lot of critical or behind-the-scenes commentary on the barge set, then it would warrant a screenshot of the barge, but there does not appear to be enough to support adding a non-free image.

It also seems to be splitting hairs a bit - the most important locations in Europe in this era were the national capitals, with country homes being far less important. I\'d suggest omitting this quote.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand exactly what you\'re getting at, but I\'d like to retain the quote unless there\'s a consensus for removal. It is, of course, an opinion and the relative importance of Chartwell and the Berghof, or anywhere else, can\'t be measured. But, following <a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a>\'s advice at PR, I have explicitly cited it as an opinion, so that any reader is clear as to its source. Second, I think Fedden had a reasonably authoritative view. He was a pre-war diplomat, and a post war Deputy Director General of the National Trust. In that latter role, he also authored the first Chartwell guidebook, from whence the quote comes. Lastly, one can see what he means - namely, no other country house in Europe became so important a centre of resistance to Nazi Germany, and no more important issue faced 1930s Europe. And he\'s probably right on both counts. Would you be ok with seeing what others think? <a href="/wiki/User:KJP1" title="User:KJP1">KJP1</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:KJP1" title="User talk:KJP1">talk</a>) 11:55, 24 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>I\'d be inclined to keep it, but only if it is attributed to an individual in the text.

You and I would be in a pretty pickle if we had lost"" - this quote seems to imply that Churchill regarded the Nuremberg trials as \'victor\'s justice\', which I don\'t believe was the case (he actually advocated for executing the Nazi leadership without trial while PM). I\'d suggest removing it.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>As before, can certainly remove if there\'s a consensus, and it\'s much less central to the history of the house than the Fedden quote.

First, that\'s wrong: change it to "two <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award" class="mw-redirect" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nominations and two <a href="/wiki/British_Academy_Film_Awards" title="British Academy Film Awards">British Academy Film Award</a> (BAFTA) nominations", and use BAFTA after that. Second, if you\'re talking about where you visited this summer, and you say "I went to London, then Bristol, then Manchester. I visited London twice and Paris twice.", then many listeners will think you visited London three times, because you\'re talking as if this is an ordered list of your destinations. After you make the change I just suggested, the lead will say: "Her performance as an aspiring socialite in The Help earned her an Academy Award nomination. In 2012, she won a Golden Globe Award and received a second Oscar nomination for playing a CIA agent in the thriller Zero Dark Thirty. Chastain made her Broadway debut in a revival of The Heiress in the same year. ... Chastain\'s accolades include two Academy Award and British Academy Film Award nominations." Most readers, especially if they\'re reading quickly, will interpret that last sentence as "two additional Academy Award nominations" (unspecified), because you appear to be presenting an ordered list of her accolades. Don\'t repeat awards in the lead section. - Dank (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 19:54, 17 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n<li>"She is known to prepare extensively for her roles": Some WPian copyeditors automatically change this to "She prepares extensively for her roles", but I think it\'s worth slowing down and trying to figure out what the source means. If they avoided saying that she actually does prepare extensively for her roles (rather than just being known for that) because they\'re hedging, then treat it as spurious information, and don\'t include it at all. If the source said "X said that she prepares extensively for her roles", and some WPian shortened that to "known for ...", then un-shorten that ... in WP articles, it\'s important who said what, unless you\'re writing some dusty history article and there really is a consensus of historians we can rely on. That\'s not going to be true for currently active actors. If the person (or persons) attributed by the source isn\'t (or aren\'t) worth attributing, for some reason, then again, that\'s your cue to leave it out entirely. Bottom line: when you see "known for" or the equivalent in any WP article, check what the source said. - Dank (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 20:07, 17 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n<li>"vocal about social issues such as gender and racial equality, and mental health": I don\'t know what this is trying to say ... is she vocal about social issues in general?

The rationale for area commands as opposed to functional commands is well explained. The quote from Hardman is ironic; only in Thailand did the RAAF operate without the other services. Britain was a lot smaller than Australia, with better communications, and Hardman\'s successors faced a long road getting the functional command structure to work. The reduction of the number of commands to just one nicely brings the article full circle, back to the situation before the Second World War. <a href="/wiki/User:Hawkeye7" title="User:Hawkeye7"><span style="color:#9933ff">Hawkeye7</span></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hawkeye7" title="User talk:Hawkeye7"><span style="font-size:80%">(talk)</span></a> 22:58, 21 August 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Tks for that Hawkeye -- I think the fact that the sources do go into the reasons for the system and its evolution (and dissolution) helped make this sort of overview a worthwhile exercise.

From memory the Army districts were even more closely aligned to state boundaries than the RAAF areas so there probably wasn\'t much of a correlation...\n<ul>\n<li>Couldn\'t find any comparisons based on a search of Ashworth, Gillison and Stephens (his Centenary of Australian Defence history and <i>Going Solo</i>)...\n<ul>\n<li>OK, fair enough. <a href="/wiki/User:Nick-D" title="User:Nick-D">Nick-D</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nick-D" title="User talk:Nick-D">talk</a>) 06:59, 22 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>"Of necessity, the two northerly commands were primarily responsible for bombing and air defence, while the other commands focussed on maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare" - I\'d suggest also noting that there were also a handful of squadrons assigned responsibility for air defence of Brisbane and the Sydney area in 1942-43, and Perth until the end of the war (I presume that these were integrated in some way with the surprisingly large network of Army AA guns).\n<ul>\n<li>I kept it to what we currently have because Stephens specifically couched things in those terms when discussing the main tasks of the northerly commands vs. the southerly. I know I could source the stuff about the air defence squadrons in the southerly areas but I think it would have to be a very bald, stand-alone statement about units at particular bases, not directly referencing the area commands.\n<ul>\n<li>Given the above I wonder if in fact it might be better to just leave discussion of units, air defence or otherwise, to the individual area command articles, which in most cases include OOBs from 1942 or later...

The five-book work describes celestial phenomena, explaining the zodiac and astrology. The poem\xe2\x80\x94which seems to have been inspired by Lucretius\'s Epicurean poem, <i>De rerum natura</i>\xe2\x80\x94espouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The work is of note for a number of reasons. First, it is seen as an answer to Lucretius\'s aforementioned poem. Second, it is an important window into Roman views on astrology and Stoicism. Third, it very barely made it to the present day, as only one manuscript transmitted the poem through the Middle Ages. Finally, its style is rather heady and peculiar, and its subject matter is very, very complicated and dense. These last few factors have led to it being described (rather hilariously, might I add) as "like a trigonometry texbook rendered as a Saturday <i>New York Times</i> crossword." Currently, it is a good article (the very thorough review can be accessed <a href="/wiki/Talk:Astronomica_(Manilius)/GA1" title="Talk:Astronomica (Manilius)/GA1">here</a>). It has also undergone two extensive peer-reviews: one in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Astronomica_(Manilius)/archive1" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Astronomica (Manilius)/archive1">June of 2016</a> (courtesy of <a href="/wiki/User:Tim_riley" title="User:Tim riley">User:Tim riley</a>, <a href="/wiki/User:Caeciliusinhorto" title="User:Caeciliusinhorto">User:Caeciliusinhorto</a>, and <a href="/wiki/User:Johnbod" title="User:Johnbod">User:Johnbod</a>), and the other in <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/Astronomica_(Manilius)/archive2" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Astronomica (Manilius)/archive2">January of 2017</a> (courtesy of <a href="/wiki/User:Groupuscule" title="User:Groupuscule">User:Groupuscule</a>). Finally, it has been copy-edited a number of times (e.g. <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomica_%28Manilius%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=739896782&amp;oldid=738911497">[9]</a>, <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomica_%28Manilius%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=764734194&amp;oldid=763829873">[10]</a>, <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomica_%28Manilius%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=794275072&amp;oldid=794213638">[11]</a>, <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astronomica_%28Manilius%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=795153019&amp;oldid=794885104">[12]</a>) by four extremely competent editors.

It\'s entirely too easy to slip into interpreting the primary sources - can none of these details be cited to secondary works instead?</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>This has not been a problem in the past, as the sources have not been \'interpreted\' to make an argument. Rather, in almost every case they have been used alongside secondary sources to provide slight additional detail, such as a specific date. Indeed, the embarkation roll is backed up by Snelling and, while all of Shout\'s awards can be verified by basically any of the secondary sources used here, the London Gazette provides the date of announcement and a complete and accurate rendering of his VC citation (though this does appear in Staunton and others too). Further, as every single one of the records are freely accessible and available online, there is not really a verifiability issue (excepting perhaps the above, which will be addressed shortly). To be honest, you\'d be hard pressed to find an FA-level article on an Australian military figure that does not use similar sourcing. As for the London Gazette, this article features just four entries \xe2\x80\x93 compare this case to <a href="/wiki/Richard_Dannatt" title="Richard Dannatt">Richard Dannatt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Donald_Hardman" title="Donald Hardman">Donald Hardman</a> (both FAs, the latter promoted just last month), which make use of dozens, though in a similar method for a similar reason. <a href="/wiki/User:Abraham,_B.S." title="User:Abraham, B.S.">Abraham, B.S.</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Abraham,_B.S." title="User talk:Abraham, B.S.">talk</a>) 01:53, 17 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>The problem is that it isn\'t clear from the way you reference what the additional details ARE. An example: "Information on Alfred Shout\'s early life is rather scant, and the details differ between sources. It is believed that he was privately educated in his youth and," is sourced to the records search (page 1) AND to Snelling. What part of the two sentences comes from the records search? There IS interpretation in this sentence - is Snelling supporting the first bit? Even if the records search is just supporting the "privately educated" ... that phrase is actually "it is believed" which is interpreting the primary source document (which is emphatic about him being privately educated on page 1). Another example: "He then joined the Stellenbosch District Mounted Troop, and served with the unit until the Boer War ended in 1902." ... which is sourced to three sources: the records search which says that he served in the "Border Horse 1900-2 (Sgt)", to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1160979">this source</a> which says "Records suggest that he also served with the Stellenbosch District Mounted Troop." and then <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1161073">this source</a> which says "He was in South Africa when, as an eighteen year old, he joined the Border Horse and later served with the Stellenbosch District Mounted Troop and the Cape Colonial Forces." None of these actually support the sentence "He then joined the Stellenbosch District Mounted Troop, and served with the unit until the Boer War ended in 1902." ... what is actually happening here is that the three sources are being combined together like a historian would to come up with a synthesized statement that isn\'t supported by the sources.</li>\n<li>Here\'s another "Following the outbreak of the First World War, Shout applied for a commission in the newly raised Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 18 August 1914." is sourced to the page 1 of the records search. But nothing on that page says anything about "following the outbreak of World War I" or that the Australian Imperial Force was "newly raised".</li>\n<li>Another "On 11 May, he was wounded once again, suffering a second gunshot to his arm. He was evacuated to the hospital ship HMHS Gascon but, having recovered sufficiently, rejoined his unit fifteen days later." - this is mostly supported by the source but it puts in details not covered by the primary source - the fact that HMHS is a hospital ship, that he was evacuated to the ship. Nor does the source explicitly state that the reason he returned to his unit was that he had recovered. We can assume that but it\'s not expressly stated.</li>\n<li>A last example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=8082877">this source</a> is given as the source for "Shout was also posthumously issued the 1914\xe2\x80\x9315 Star, British War Medal, and Victory Medal for his service during the First World War." but nothing in that record states whether it was posthumous or not. It just says he was awarded these awards in addition to the VC.</li>\n<li>I\'m not trying to be a pain here, but it\'s difficult to use primary sources in wikipedia because it is so tempting to interpret them or add information that included in them. <a href="/wiki/User:Ealdgyth" title="User:Ealdgyth">Ealdgyth</a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ealdgyth" title="User talk:Ealdgyth">Talk</a> 15:28, 26 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>I randomly googled three sentences and nothing showed up except mirrors. <a class="external text" href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/copyvios/?lang=en&amp;project=wikipedia&amp;title=Alfred+Shout&amp;oldid=&amp;action=search&amp;use_engine=1&amp;use_links=1&amp;turnitin=0">Earwig\'s tool</a> shows no signs of copyright violations - the things it\'s flagging up are the long quote from the citation for the VC, which is properly quoted and attributed.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>Otherwise everything looks good. <a href="/wiki/User:Ealdgyth" title="User:Ealdgyth">Ealdgyth</a> - <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ealdgyth" title="User talk:Ealdgyth">Talk</a> 18:33, 16 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Thanks for checking, Ealdgyth!

I hope an FAC coordinator can clear up whether I should withdraw this one or not, given that my other FAC is one step away from closure. <b><a href="/wiki/User:SounderBruce" title="User:SounderBruce"><span style="background:#5d9731; color:white; padding:2px;">Sounder</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:SounderBruce" title="User talk:SounderBruce"><span style="background:#1047AB; color:white; padding:2px;">Bruce</span></a></b> 05:10, 23 August 2017 (UTC)\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, I overlooked that this was a second solo nom when it was transcluded.

McNair/archive1">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>While this article is in good shape, I think that it would have benefited from a Military History Wikiproject A-class review prior to this nomination. In particular, I don\'t think that it really captures the debates over McNair\'s performance in World War II. This is a complex topic: from what I\'ve read, while historians tend to strongly approve of some elements of his approach and strongly disapprove of others, what they like and dislike varies considerably! I have the following comments on the World War II section:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>"In addition to Mark Clark, other officers who served on McNair\'s AGF staff and later achieved prominence included: Alexander R. Bolling; Floyd Lavinius Parks; James T. Duke; Willard Stewart Paul; Lyman Lemnitzer; and Robert A. Hewitt" - does this need to be specified? It\'s not surprising that some of the officers at this very high level and large HQ went on to achieve prominence during the war.</li>\n<li>"McNair identified difficulty with training National Guard units" - slightly awkward wording</li>\n<li>"He recommended demobilizing the National Guard" - did he really want to stand down the Guard units (and their personnel), or disband the often-dysfunctional Guard units to free up their personnel?</li>\n<li>Regarding the \'Fielding army divisions\' section, wasn\'t one of the goals to have a smallish number of high-quality units rather than a large number of average-quality units? The US Army\'s divisions of World War II were pound for pound probably the best-equipped of any combatant (for instance, the standard US Army infantry division of 1944 was more mobile and had more firepower than the supposedly elite German Panzergrenadier divisions, of which Germany only ever fielded a small number). I believe that most historians regard the organisational structure as a success.</li>\n<li>The \'Individual replacement system\' section seems much too kind to McNair. In particular, the statement that " more recent assessments have viewed it more favorably" isn\'t supported by the source: its Thomas Ricks quoting with approval a ten year old paper. Recent works continue to be highly critical of this system (in particular, how inexperianced soldiers were posted to combat units while they were on the front lines, leading to appalling and avoidable casualty rates)</li>\n<li>"McNair attempted to improve recruiting into the AGF through improved public relations" - given that the US had conscription and most conscripts were allocated to the Army, why was this necessary?</li>\n<li>The \'legacy\' section should note the continuing debates over McNair\'s role in the war. <a href="/wiki/User:Nick-D" title="User:Nick-D">Nick-D</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nick-D" title="User talk:Nick-D">talk</a>) 01:43, 13 August 2017 (UTC)\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/wiki/User:Billmckern" title="User:Billmckern">Billmckern</a>, how are you going working through these comments?

McNair/archive1">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>I reviewed this article at GA. I have to agree with Nick that this is a complex topic. So don\'t feel bad about it. And debates over his performance go a lot further than just military historians, being the subject of heated debate among professionals over the years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In answer to Nick, whether one of the goals to have a smallish number of high-quality units rather than a large number of average-quality units? No, the goal was to have a large number of average-quality units. But the ground Army was forced to halt at 89 divisions ("the 89-division gamble") instead of the 250 originally envisaged.</li>\n<li>Having fewer divisions led directly to the problem with the divisions being in combat for too long. Replacement shortages led to melting most of the separate regiments into the replacement stream, exacerbating the problem. It also led to divisions being stripped for replacements, which disrupted McNair\'s training regime.</li>\n<li>US equipment was not invariably better than the enemy\'s. Case in point is the heavy artillery, which was used because the German medium artillery outranged its US counterparts. . See Mayo, <i>On Beachhead and Battlefront</i>, pp. 202-204. Note that McNair was an advocate of heavy artillery. See Greenfield, Palmer &amp; Wiley <i>The Organization of Ground Combat Troops</i>, pp. 233\xe2\x80\x93234</li>\n<li>The individual replacement issue was a vexing one because it would recur in Vietnam. Despite far less intense combat, the divisions slowly degraded. As a result, unit rotation was chosen for the War in Iraq.</li>\n<li>The article is still too soft on McNair\'s opposition to the heavier tank. See Thomson and Roots, <i>Planning Munitions for War</i>, pp. 280-283 (available online) McNair: "the M4 tank, particularly the M4A3, has been widely hailed as the best tank on the battlefield today ... Other than this particular request, which represents the British view\xe2\x80\x94there has been no call from any theater for a 90mm tank gun. There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank ... there can be no basis for the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank versus tank duel\xe2\x80\x94which is believed unsound and unnecessary ... there is no indication that the 76mm antitank gun is inadequate against the Mark VI (Tiger) tank."</li>\n<li>The downsized armoured division was resisted, with the 2nd and 3rd remaining on the old establishment.</li>\n<li>Note that McNair doubted the value of the armoured divisions, and suggested reducing their number to six. It became frozen at sixteen. See Greenfield, Palmer &amp; Wiley <i>The Organization of Ground Combat Troops</i>, pp. 332\xe2\x80\x93335</li>\n<li>There is also the light divisision schmozzle, and McNair proposal to convert airborne divisions into light divisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Source review</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calhoun\'s 2015 book is not used as a reference; move it to the "Further reading" section</li>\n<li>Nor is his West Point memorial page</li>\n<li>And the last of the external links.

Being a singer - this is generally stated (e.g. Carter says he presumably trained as a singer as he later gave vocal lessons) but I am having difficulty finding specific evidence at the moment.....<a href="/wiki/User:Brianboulton" title="User:Brianboulton">Brian</a>, do you have anything? <a href="/wiki/User:Smerus" title="User:Smerus">Smerus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Smerus" title="User talk:Smerus">talk</a>) 08:40, 17 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>There is little evidence to suggest that singing was a major factor in Monteverdi\'s professional life; in my view, not enough to justify the headline description of him as a "singer", and I suggest we drop this. Similiarly, I think the description of him as a "string player" is questionable. Although this was the role he took when first employed in the Mantuan court, it\'s hardly what he became famous for. I would prefer to see him identified in the lead as a "composer and choirmaster", which I think more accurately summarises his career. <a href="/wiki/User:Brianboulton" title="User:Brianboulton">Brianboulton</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Brianboulton" title="User talk:Brianboulton">talk</a>) 09:47, 17 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>He describes himself as a string player in the intros to the 2nd and 3rd books of madrigals, and this is mentioned and cited in the article, so I think that should certainly stay.

Monteverdi was active, professionally, over quite a small area.

Braunsbedra and Reichertswerben are the two closest villages and they are, respectively, altitudes above sea level of: 120 meters (394&#160;ft) and 131 meters (430&#160;ft). The site of the battle field is rolling hills and plains between 120\xe2\x80\x93244, mostly between Braunsbedra, Rossbach and Reichertswerben. But the entire topography outside the villages, where the battle took place, has changed since the mid-20th century (and earlier) because of lignite mining. The steepest hillsides are in Merseburg at the river crossings, and then only in a few places where the river cut through sandstone. If you look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://mapcarta.com/18235760">Mapcarta here</a> you can see that the location of the Janus has been completely excavated. There is really no way of telling exactly how high or how steep it was in 1750s. Carlisle, who was there, says the hills were slight. Frederick and Gaudi, who were there and observing from the manor rooftop, could see most of the French troop movements--this means that the hills were not high enough to obstruct the view. The vintage maps do not indicate steep hills, simply "hills" or elevation changes.

Some hard work has clearly been put into this since the last nomination, but some key areas are still a problem. The prose is often a concern: witness paragraphs such as "After twelve years of rigorous penance, at the age of 43, Mahavira achieved the state of Kevala Jnana (omniscience or infinite knowledge) under a S\xc4\x81la tree according to traditional accounts.[53][61][62] The details of this event are mentioned in Jain texts like Uttar-pur\xc4\x81\xc5\x86a and Harivam\xc5\x9ba-pur\xc4\x81\xc5\x86a.[63] The Acharanga Sutra describes Mahavira as all-seeing. The Sutrakritanga elaborates the concept as all-knowing and provides details of other qualities of Mahavira.[5] Jains believe that Mahavira had the most auspicious body (paramaud\xc4\x81rika \xc5\x9bar\xc4\xabra) and was free from eighteen imperfections when he attained omniscience.[64]" Within the Jain biography section, there is still problems with the article presenting Jain beliefs in Wikipedia\'s voice; the section title is not enough to cover the rest of the prose. The section on his ideological influence, which is large, rests on two large quotations, and has little other substance. Overall, I am concerned that the article has too much content in the form of lists, and too little substance.

This article has recently succeeded in passing its Good Article candidacy and has seen some massive improvements since then, although it is now stable with very little editing activity going on. There were some disagreements between another editor and I over some of the content and wording of the article, but we have since come to a consensus on how the article should look. I hope you enjoy reading the article as much as I enjoyed writing it. The article is filled with a rich amount of historical details that should keep you entertained if you\'re a history buff like me. I\'ve written and nominated various articles on European and Chinese history for FA status, but this is only the second African-history related article that I\'ve nominated, the first being <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_literature" title="Ancient Egyptian literature">Ancient Egyptian literature</a>.

Some initial comments, more to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>"The Church of Saint George, Lalibela and a panel painting inside depicting Saint George slaying a dragon; it is one of eleven monumental rock-hewn churches built in Lalibela, Ethiopia that were allegedly sculpted after a vision by the Zagwe-dynasty ruler Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (r. 1185\xe2\x80\x931225 AD), in which St George instructed him to do so.[18][19] The city of Lalibela was reestablished as a symbolic new holy site, following the fall of Jerusalem to the Muslim forces of Saladin in 1187 AD, yet archaeology reveals the religious structures to have been built between the 10th and early 12th centuries AD, with perhaps only the last phase carried out during the 13th century AD and reign of Gebre Mesqel Lalibela." - a very long caption, and failed the MOS test for me. I\'d advise trimming after "...slaying a dragon."</li>\n<li>File:St. George Astride His Horse, Church of Bet Giorgis, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3268383996).jpg needs a copyright tag for the underlying image (could be done in a similar way to File:Gebre Mesqel Lalibela.png, for example).

I have done several things to address your concerns listed above.</p>\n<p>(1) Per your requests, I have shortened the captions for the "File:Bete_Giyorgis_06.jpg" and "File:Aba_Gorgorios,_1681.jpg" images.</p>\n<p>(2) I have resized nearly every image after the "Zagwe dynasty" sub-section, and have removed several pictures. Keep in mind, though, that not every monitor and not eevry browser presents the page the same way. Are you viewing this on a mobile device? The page looks fine to me, but I have edited the article per your advice regardless.</p>\n<p>(3) I\'m not sure what sort of tag I would need for "Ethopian tag to cover photography of 2D art image", so I have simply removed the three images you have mentioned as being problematic. This is perhaps a temporary move until I am able to properly tag those images, but I guarantee that they will stay removed from the article until that happens. I just hope it doesn\'t lead to an edit war with the editor who added all three of them to the article. Since I added the majority of images to the article in its present incarnation, he might take this as some sort of slight or that I\'m deliberately attacking the contributions he has made. I hope that won\'t be the case. Perhaps he can even help in locating the appropriate tags. I\'d like for you to elaborate more on this in the meantime, though.</p>\n<p>(4) You wrote that "File:St. George Astride His Horse, Church of Bet Giorgis, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3268383996).jpg needs a copyright tag for the underlying image (could be done in a similar way to File:Gebre Mesqel Lalibela.png, for example). The other historical images need checking in this regard as well." - I think you made some sort of mistake here. These two files actually share the exact same tags (i.e. "PD-Art|PD-old-100" and "PD-1923"). I also think your suggestion here is unwarranted given how this article has already passed the initial image review and inspection of media content by <a href="/wiki/User:Adityavagarwal" title="User:Adityavagarwal">User:Adityavagarwal</a>. I\'m willing to cooperate on any further suggestions you might have, but I think your particular point here is moot.

Just "Lord Rothschild" would be correct everyday form.</li>\n<li>"Mark Sykes" was "Sir Mark Sykes" at the time, and was rather more than "a British War Cabinet secretary", which makes him sound like a typist. "A senior member of the British War Cabinet secretariat" might be a better indication of his rank.</li>\n<li>The way it\'s currently written, it sounds as though Sykes began discussions with Weitzmann on his own initiative, out of the blue. I would preface this sentence with "In accordance with government policy, which was increasingly favouring Zionism,..." (or some such wording)</li>\n<li>Repetitions in second line of final paragraph: "ongoing...ongoing", and "conflict...conflict".</li>\n<li>Like others, I think including the text of the declaration in the lead as well as in the infobox is unnecessary. Do you actually need the infobox at all? It contains nothing of note that\'s not in the first paragraph of the text. A possible alternative to the infobox is illustrated <a href="/wiki/User:Brianboulton/sandbox" title="User:Brianboulton/sandbox">here</a> - replacing it with a quote box containing the declaration\'s text, and obviating the need to repeat it in the body of the lead.</li>\n<li>The image in the current infobox gives an impression that the declaration document was headed "Balfour Declaration", which was not the case. Incidentally, it would be interesting to know when the document first acquired this name \xe2\x80\x93 was it from the very outset, or a later appellation given by historians?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from these minor issues, I have a major problem with the article as presently constructed. In addition to its main text, there are more than 10,000 additional words of "Primary supporting quotes" and "Explanatory notes and scholarly perspectives" \xe2\x80\x93 considerably exceeding the length of the article itself. Some of the notes are, individually, quite lengthy essays running to several hundred words. I don\'t believe that this approach is what is intended for Wikipedia, which is about providing articles in plain style for the general reader, not for researchers or academic historians. The authors should reconsider the nature of their intended readership, with a view to removing much of this explanatory material. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a> might be a useful guideline. <a href="/wiki/User:Brianboulton" title="User:Brianboulton">Brianboulton</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Brianboulton" title="User talk:Brianboulton">talk</a>) 12:04, 14 August 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Response_to_Brianboulton">Response to Brianboulton</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Balfour_Declaration/archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-6" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Balfour Declaration/archive1">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Many thanks <a href="/wiki/User:Brianboulton" title="User:Brianboulton">Brianboulton</a>. Comments on your points in turn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I agree that "Lord Walter Rothschild" is wrong. However, we need a way to differentiate him from two other contemporary Baron Rothschilds (in England Baron = Lord), much better known in politics, his father <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Rothschild,_1st_Baron_Rothschild" title="Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild">Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild</a> who died a couple of years before the declaration and his distant cousin <a href="/wiki/Edmond_James_de_Rothschild" title="Edmond James de Rothschild">Baron Edmond James de Rothschild</a> (who was, I believe, not an English Baron but an Austrian <a href="/wiki/Freiherr" title="Freiherr">Freiherr</a>, but who used the style Baron in England). Walter was not a particularly political or financial man, so it is notable that it was him in particular.</li>\n<li>Agreed re Sir Mark. It seems his entitlement as a sir was in his Baronetcy inherited from his father, rather than being knighted. I have made both these changes</li>\n<li>Agreed re Sykes\'s authorization; I have added wording to clarify</li>\n<li>As to the infobox, that\'s an interesting idea. I am neutral on this and will wait to let consensus form.</li>\n<li>The caption below the picture in the infobox is intended to explain that the declaration itself is within the letter. The name "Balfour Declaration" formed very early. It was used frequently in the reports of both the 1919 <a href="/wiki/King%E2%80%93Crane_Commission" title="King\xe2\x80\x93Crane Commission">King\xe2\x80\x93Crane Commission</a> and the 1920 <a href="/wiki/Palin_Commission" title="Palin Commission">Palin Commission</a></li>\n<li>As to the notes, in the original nomination above I linked to the ANI discussion on the topic. The subject of this article is the origin of perhaps the most controversial and hotly debated of all modern conflicts. I have edited in the Israel Palestine area for some time, and have learned that quotes in footnotes are a must in order to avoid edit wars on controversial topics. As it says at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:IPCOLL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:IPCOLL">WP:IPCOLL</a>, every topic is described differently by both sides. Israelis, Palestinians and their respective supporters come to read this article all the time - when they see something that doesn\'t fit the narrative they thought they knew, let\'s just say that they do not bother to go and check the source book out of the library before editing. <a href="/wiki/User:Onceinawhile" title="User:Onceinawhile">Onceinawhile</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Onceinawhile" title="User talk:Onceinawhile">talk</a>) 22:01, 14 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>Seconded, on the last point. Some quotes are useful to get some insight into the topic. Around the time of the ANI discussion, I made an attempt to shorten the quotes, but judging from the overall discussion, people didn\'t find the practice problematic; so I discontinued the attempt. There were some concerns raised about copyright, but from what I saw, most people agreed that it did not fall into copyvio territory. <a href="/wiki/User:Kingsindian" title="User:Kingsindian">Kingsindian</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kingsindian" title="User talk:Kingsindian">\xe2\x99\x9d</a>&#160;<a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kingsindian" title="Special:Contributions/Kingsindian">\xe2\x99\x9a</a> 11:13, 15 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>I\'m afraid I disagree with both of you. I accept that, to an extent, explanatory footnotes which incorporate verbatim source material can have some useful function in backing up possibly contentious statements in the article text. But this should be done sparingly; when the notes amount to considerably more in size than the text they are supporting, and when some of the individual footnotes are essays of several hundred words, my eyebrows remain raised. Were you writing for a scholarly journal, the argument might be different (though I think the editor of such a journal might well insist on some cutback in the notes). But this is an encyclopedia; we should be writing principally for a general readership who require a clear straightforward summary account of the topic and, I am certain, will not read the notes and may well be intimidated by them. The subject is controversial, but not more so than many other subjects, none of which as far as I can see have adopted your pre-retaliatory approach. Alas, those who are determined to challenge your coverage will find ways of doing so regardless \xe2\x80\x93 you simply can\'t anticipate every point of contention, and I worry that attempting to do so creates further problems, not least a great strain on readability. <a href="/wiki/User:Brianboulton" title="User:Brianboulton">Brianboulton</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Brianboulton" title="User talk:Brianboulton">talk</a>) 23:08, 18 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>I agree with this part of your comments "when the notes amount to considerably more in size than the text they are supporting, and when some of the individual footnotes are essays of several hundred words, my eyebrows remain raised"(although even adjusting just this may itself cause controversy).<a href="/wiki/User:Selfstudier" title="User:Selfstudier">Selfstudier</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Selfstudier" title="User talk:Selfstudier">talk</a>) 11:57, 22 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>So, by way of example, I would (personally) not object to removal of primary source note f (the first lengthy one I come to going down the page); while of interest, its removal (imo) would not affect the article in any significant way.<a href="/wiki/User:Selfstudier" title="User:Selfstudier">Selfstudier</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Selfstudier" title="User talk:Selfstudier">talk</a>) 15:31, 22 August 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fragment_of_a_Crucifixion"><a href="/wiki/Fragment_of_a_Crucifixion" title="Fragment of a Crucifixion">Fragment of a Crucifixion</a></span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Fragment_of_a_Crucifixion/archive2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Fragment of a Crucifixion/archive2">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<dl>\n<dd><small><i>Nominator(s): <a href="/wiki/User:Ceoil" title="User:Ceoil">Ceoil</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ceoil" title="User talk:Ceoil">talk</a>) 19:36, 30 July 2017 (UTC)</i></small></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Post war horror by the painter <a href="/wiki/Francis_Bacon_(artist)" title="Francis Bacon (artist)">Francis Bacon</a>.

I\'m not keen on this; the way you refer to "the mouth", for example, seems to take for granted that it\'s the same mouth in both paintings. How about something like "The mouth in Rubens\' painting is loosely opened, but the mouth in Bacon\'s is taut.

This suggestions that <i>Fragment</i> is itself an "invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and slabs of meat", though a less direct one than <i>Three Studies</i>.

You may wish to adjust overall widths to suit what you had in mind - I left them at 450px. I am not familiar with the workings of multiple images, and have hesitated to use them because of possible accessibility issues such as overriding the users image width choice, and I have no idea how they display on mobile. However I think we have a situation where we are choosing a lesser evil, and image formatting can always be changed when the software is improved. With this in mind, there are other possible combinations for multiple images. How far do you think it is advisable to go? I will combine a couple more to see how it looks.

It\'s really, really hard to take a big topic like this and make it your first attempt at FAC, but I think you\'ve done a good job with this article. I cleaned up a few minor things while reading it and came up with the following points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><s>The most important issue is that there is some uncited content (either whole paragraphs or the ends of paragraphs) in Breathhold limitations (admittedly basic stuff), Diving environment, Medical aspects of diving, and Risks and safety. The coordinators will be reluctant to promote this as long as that content remains uncited, and even if it is promoted some random editor will be sure to put cite tags there on main page day; I\'ve seen it happen quite a few times before.</s>\n<dl>\n<dd>Busy with this one. One down, 3 or 4 to go. \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 <a href="/wiki/User:Pbsouthwood" title="User:Pbsouthwood">Peter (Southwood)</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Pbsouthwood" title="User talk:Pbsouthwood"><sup>(talk)</sup></a>: 08:43, 8 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Just one more, that is proving surprisingly recalcitrant, considering its importance as a general principle of diving safety. \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 <a href="/wiki/User:Pbsouthwood" title="User:Pbsouthwood">Peter (Southwood)</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Pbsouthwood" title="User talk:Pbsouthwood"><sup>(talk)</sup></a>: 14:54, 8 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Remove unreferenced statement. It is sufficiently logical that readers should come to that conclusion from the rest of the context. I may replace it if I find a suitable reference, but it is not critical. \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 <a href="/wiki/User:Pbsouthwood" title="User:Pbsouthwood">Peter (Southwood)</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Pbsouthwood" title="User talk:Pbsouthwood"><sup>(talk)</sup></a>: 16:05, 9 August 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li><s>Breathhold limitations: The first paragraph consists solely of links to three articles. Was this meant to be part of the hatnote here?</s>\n<dl>\n<dd>Even worse - they were notes to link to those articles I made as an aide-memoire when I started the section, and then forgot. Now moved to where they should have been.</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li><s>Surface supplied diving: Is Snuba supposed to be capitalized? I thought I should ask here, as I wasn\'t comfortable changing it without knowledge of the subject.</s>\n<dl>\n<dd>It is a trade name which is probably becoming genericised. As far as I know it is still normally capitalised, unlike scuba, which has been around as a generic term for far longer.</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li><s>History: I can\'t say that I\'m in love with the bold text here. We don\'t need to have this in bold just because the full article on the subject begins that way.</s>\n<dl>\n<dd>Quite agree, changed.</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li><s>I see a mention of Second World War in the lead and one of World War II in History. You should probably pick one style and stick with it consistently, though I have no strong preference either way.</s>\n<dl>\n<dd>Agreed, and changed.</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li><s>Diver training: This section has a couple of small paragraphs, including a one-sentence "Further training is required..." paragraph. Would it be possible to merge a couple of these so they don\'t appear so stubby?</s>\n<dl>\n<dd>Done. I used the best fit I could think of.</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li><s>This is just a suggestion, but you might want to check the article for wikilinks that are duplicated. I\'m seeing a lot of them, particularly in the History section, and typically only one link is needed per subject in the body. It is sometimes considered acceptable to have multiple links for a longer article like this, but some of the overlinking here is bordering on overkill.</s>\n<dl>\n<dd>I recently eliminated several redundant links. Those which remain are unique to a major section. I left them as they may be useful to the reader, who otherwise might not easily find the link if there were only one in the whole article. My own experience is that if it is not easy to find a link within about a page up or down from the term in question, it is easier and quicker to just do a Wikipedia search, and that reduces the value of the links. Your experience may differ, and I know that WP:OVERLINK does not agree. I am open to logical persuasion on this point. It is possible that some of the links may be considered trivial or unnecessary and if you prefer to remove some of the duplicates, I will not object, but I find it difficult to decide which ones should go.</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li><s>I\'m not doing a full source review here, but I noticed that references 4 and 13 have different styles in their access dates than those in the rest of the cites.

Personally I slightly prefer the hyphenated version, but I am quite happy to go with any version that can be supported by reasonably convincing evidence. If we can come to a satisfactory consensus on this, it will probably become a project guideline. I suggest that a straight comparison of number of Google hits may be misleading - the context should be considered.

I have no definitive statistics for relative frequency, but it seems that while there may be some doubt for <i>breathhold</i>, and <i>breath hold</i> may occasionally be slightly ambiguous, there is a fairly extensive body of acceptance for <i>breath-hold</i> among academics, so unless there are objections, I propose to use this as the standard, and recommend it as a guideline at WikiProject Scuba diving, \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 <a href="/wiki/User:Pbsouthwood" title="User:Pbsouthwood">Peter (Southwood)</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Pbsouthwood" title="User talk:Pbsouthwood"><sup>(talk)</sup></a>: 06:35, 26 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>Scuba is a bit different. WikiProject Scuba diving already has a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Scuba_diving#Guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Scuba diving">guideline on this</a>, which is to consistently use sentence case for scuba. The explanation is in one of the articles, which I will look up and link here. It was originally an acronym, but has become an ordinary noun through usage. When used <i>as an acronym</i> it would be proper to use all caps, but when used as an ordinary noun or adjective, as in scuba diving, scuba equipment, scuba regulator, scuba skills, scuba instructor etc, the sentence case is more appropriate, and common usage over the last 40 years or so has shifted to using sentence case unless specifically intended to mean Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus - the complete breathing set, without trimmings, open or closed circuit, and even in this case scuba is commonly accepted as an alternative. You may notice that the WikiProject title also uses sentence case, following this convention, and this goes back to before my time here.</li>\n<li>The explanation I was looking for can be seen at <a href="/wiki/Scuba_diving#Etymology" title="Scuba diving">Scuba diving#Etymology</a>.

I\'m not convinced the comma after "coins" is grammatical, but I understand you probably added it to aid the reader in parsing the sentence. To avoid the problem, what if you reworked it something like "Despite a Royal Commission, the drive for decimalisation soon died out for the time; there was only lukewarm support for an 1855 motion in the Commons applauding the issuance of the florin and seeking further decimal coins." <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 02:29, 6 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n<li>"From 1864 until 1879, many florins were struck with die numbers on the obverse (found to the right of Victoria\'s brooch,[13] possibly part of a Mint investigation into die wear." For coin buffs, this usage of "die" may be common, but I personally got a little confused initially what "die numbers" and "die wear" referred to ("wear" also having multiple meanings). Consider possibly wiki-linking "die" to <a href="/wiki/Coining_(mint)" title="Coining (mint)">Coining (mint)</a>\xe2\x80\x94that could reduce confusion some? Also, it\'s a little wordier, but maybe "die wear" could be changed to something like "the wearing down of dies"?

It shows a windswept figure of Britannia standing holding a shield with her left hand and a trident with her right, and inscribed ONE FLORIN TWO SHILLINGS, with the date below." This passage includes both a description and appraisal of the appearance of the Britannia. I wonder whether the flow would be stronger if you brought this closer to the description and appraisal of the Britannia Peter Seaby that appears a little lower. As it is now, the flow is appraisal/description \xe2\x80\x93 background information \xe2\x80\x93 appraisal/description. <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 03:06, 6 August 2017 (UTC)<br /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>George V (1910\xe2\x80\x931936)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>"While the weight and diameter of the coin were unchanged, due to rises in the price of silver, the metallic composition was changed in 1920 from 0.925 silver to 50% silver, 40% copper, 10% nickel, then again in 1922 to 50% silver, 50% copper, and again in 1927 to 50% silver, 40% copper, 5% nickel, 5% zinc." The reader may initially parse such that "due to rises in the price of silver" goes with what precedes rather than what follows it, and then have to double back to make sense of the sentence as a whole. To eliminate this possibility, how about something like: "The weight and diameter of the coin were unchanged; however, due to rises in the price of silver, the metallic composition was changed in 1920 from 0.925 silver to 50% silver, 40% copper, 10% nickel, then again in 1922 to 50% silver, 50% copper, and again in 1927 to 50% silver, 40% copper, 5% nickel, 5% zinc." <a href="/wiki/User:Moisejp" title="User:Moisejp">Moisejp</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Moisejp" title="User talk:Moisejp">talk</a>) 03:18, 6 August 2017 (UTC)<br /></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elizabeth II (struck 1953\xe2\x80\x931970)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>"On 30 June 1993, following the issuance of the smaller ten pence piece, the old florin was demonetised.

I may have been presumptuous just now and I presumed that your "I\'ve done those" meant that you intended to include my "due to the price in silver" suggestion and that you may have accidentally missed it, so I took the liberty of changing it myself.

Please revert if you disagree with the change, but I do urge you to do something with the sentence, which I feel did not read totally smoothly as it was.

Past tense might be more appropriate than present tense in some places in your text. In "its popularity with hip hop in particular has made it one of the most influential inventions", "has made it" is present perfect, and I think the natural assumption of most readers from that would be that the machines are still around and functioning, which can\'t be right if "impossible to restock" is right.

That\'s not the intended meaning of the sentence. There are indeed many functioning 808s in use around the world. The Development section says: "Kakehashi deliberately purchased faulty transistors to create the machine\'s distinctive "sizzling" sound.[8]" The machine used "bad" transistors, by design, because they create a particular sound. Kakehashi would go to transistor manufacturers and buy their broken transistors off them to use in the machine. When the manufacturers improved their manufacturing processes, they stopped producing these particular broken transistors, and so Roland could no longer build the 808s.</li>\n<li>If you think the sentence is confusing, though, maybe we should rephrase it. It might not be necessary in the lead to mention that the components were faulty. We could simplify it to: "Roland ended production in 1983 after the transistors that were an essential part of its design became impossible to restock."

There is no "author" listed in the references section that is "UDPS" - (for that matter, the abbreviation UDPS doesn\'t appear at ALL in the references, but that\'s hopefully going to be fixed another way). That short citation goes to ""In Memoriam&#160;: Marcel Lihau: 1931 - 1999" (in French). Union pour la D\xc3\xa9mocratie et le Progr\xc3\xa8s Social. 1999.

So ... there isn\'t an abbreviation UDPS, the date doesn\'t appear at the front like the other full citations, and the first bit is "In Memoriam"... it isn\'t at all consistent with the rest of the references which all start "author last name, author first name, (date)". So they won\'t be able to figure it out as they would be with a citation for "Emmerson 1968" (which is easily matched up with "Emmerson, Donald K. (1968). Students and Politics in Developing Nations. New York: Praeger." if the links don\'t work (say if it\'s printed) or if (like many of our readers, I suspect) they don\'t understand that the linked short citation will take them to the full citation. If you have a lot of these sorts of things, the solution might be "UDPS Staff" or "FCE Staff" or "Africana Library Journal Staff".

Parliament was also technically suspended. I have chosen not to explain the coup in detail in the article because its implications were very complex and have little to do with Lihau\'s career. For example, Kasa-Vubu was able to partially reassert his political power within a month of the coup, while Lumumba attempted to flee to the eastern portion of the country to reestablish his government.

I\'m drawn to conclude this from mostly minor news reports I\'ve seen from the 1980s and 1990s, which often quote Lihau saying something critical about Zaire. It seems certain media outlets found him to be a good source of commentary whenever they were doing a story on the country. They quotes mostly insignificant on their own and, though fascinating (in 1988 he remarked that "Mobutu is the constitution in Zaire"), might be difficult to smoothly incorporate into the article.</li>\n<li>Fixed.</li>\n<li>Originally it was just the French and then the acronym. Another reviewer (<a href="/wiki/User:Gertanis" title="User:Gertanis">Gertanis</a>) requested that I add the English translations. I personally think the translations are unnecessary, as they are of proper names. Unfortunately, MoS is lacking in guidance on this matter. It seems consensus between reviewers might have to determine the solution.\n<dl>\n<dd>OK; could we compromise by keeping the French and acronym, as you originally had it, but with the English translation in a footnote? I think that would meet Gertanis\'s request and would not clutter up the text too much. <a href="/wiki/User:Mike_Christie" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Mike_Christie" title="User talk:Mike Christie">talk</a> - <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/Mike_Christie" title="Special:Contributions/Mike Christie">contribs</a> - <a href="/wiki/User:Mike_Christie/Reference_library" title="User:Mike Christie/Reference library">library</a>) 08:30, 20 August 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li>I\'ve kept the wording close to the source, which says, "[Lihau] argued that the 1974 Constitution did not eliminate judicial independence, but merely veiled it." The source does explain some of his reasoning (alongside that of an agreeing magistrate) but I can only see it in Google Books snippet view, which makes it difficult to work out the details. I have been able to extract, "Justice Lihau explained that the name \'Judicial Council\' itself obscured the reality of a continuing judicial power and was chosen for political reasons." As the source explains, "Judicial Council" was the new term the 1974 Constitution used to refer to the judicial branch of the MPR (Dictator Mobutu\'s political party and the official institution of the state). It notes, "Instead of declaring the independence of the magistracy [like the previous charters], the 1974 Constitution states that the magistrate is independent in his mission to determine what the law provides." It also says that Lihau acknowledged that he, as a magistrate, issued opinions in the name of Mobutu. Make of this what you will. With my limited knowledge on the 1974 Constitution, I surmise that Lihau\'s thoughts were probably something along the lines of "Though the judiciary is now nominally integrated into Mobutu\'s administration, this is simply a political motion to represent the unity of the MPR, the government, and the nation. It shall function independently of the executive as before." Mobutu obviously disagreed.\n<dl>\n<dd>How about requesting the relevant source pages at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RX" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RX">WP:RX</a>?

Done.</li>\n<li>For Lihau\'s purposes, we\'re leaning more on the lacking side. The legacy of the CNS was, as Congolese historian Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja put it in 2004, political by nature, while the institutional framework it produced (including Lihau\'s constitutional recommendations, I presume) was "no longer viable" because it is "outdated and impossible to reconstruct in any meaningful way". Besides, one could argue that the real turning point in the Congo for political progress was Mobutu\'s ousting in 1997 via civil war. In the article I\'ve written "The conference disbanded in December 1992 having greatly reinvigorated democratic thought in the country but ultimately failing to enact significant institutional change."</li>\n<li>Ah, that\'s because I used two sources in this article and only one for the Kanza page. Fox was rather vague about their separation, but does say that it was because of how Lihau\'s activities had brought government abuse upon him. The UDPS statement uses the word "separated" (translated from French, but I double checked to make sure it wasn\'t "divorced") to describe the couple and mentions that this separation occurred in the late 1970s. So I think this article gives the more correct impression.

Every article that I can remember at FAC about an active player has slipped appallingly after promotion as the nominator has not stayed around to keep the article up to date and of the required quality. Most have ended up at FAR. Part of me wonders how we can be certain that this will be stable? Perhaps this is something that should be discussed at WT:FAC, but this is a good starting point as I don\'t think we\'ve had many nominations for current sportspeople recently. <a href="/wiki/User:Sarastro1" title="User:Sarastro1">Sarastro1</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Sarastro1" title="User talk:Sarastro1">talk</a>) 22:12, 30 July 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Sarastro1" title="User:Sarastro1">Sarastro1</a>:The stability criterion was originally intended to address instability at the time of promotion -- editwars and so on -- which meant there was no stable version to be reviewed.

I don\'t think we\'ve ever had consensus to regard articles on people whose noteworthy accomplishments are still in process as unstable in the sense of 1e.

ZETA is representative of the fusion field\'s history - a theoretical breakthrough suggests a new route to fusion power, a reactor is built to take advantage of the design, it proves not to work, and fixing it requires a larger and more expensive design. Unlike other examples, however, ZETA had the rather unfortunate problem of announcing it was successful in very public fashion in newspapers around the world and then having to retract the claim. In spite of this embarrassing event, ZETA went on to have a very productive career and provided several important advances in the field.</p>\n<p><a href="/wiki/User:Maury_Markowitz" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury Markowitz</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Maury_Markowitz" title="User talk:Maury Markowitz">talk</a>) 20:35, 17 July 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Image review</dt>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/wiki/File:ZETA_reactor_left_side.jpg" title="File:ZETA reactor left side.jpg">File:ZETA reactor left side.jpg</a>, <a href="/wiki/File:Mark_2_Torus_on_display.jpg" title="File:Mark 2 Torus on display.jpg">File:Mark 2 Torus on display.jpg</a>, <a href="/wiki/File:ZETA_being_operated.jpg" title="File:ZETA being operated.jpg">File:ZETA being operated.jpg</a>, <a href="/wiki/File:ZETA_reactor_from_above.jpg" title="File:ZETA reactor from above.jpg">File:ZETA reactor from above.jpg</a>, <a href="/wiki/File:ZETA_close_up.jpg" title="File:ZETA close up.jpg">File:ZETA close up.jpg</a>, <a href="/wiki/File:ZETA_reactor_during_television_interview.jpg" title="File:ZETA reactor during television interview.jpg">File:ZETA reactor during television interview.jpg</a>, <a href="/wiki/File:ZETA_scientists.jpg" title="File:ZETA scientists.jpg">File:ZETA scientists.jpg</a>, <a href="/wiki/File:Thompson_scattering_experiment_1964.jpg" title="File:Thompson scattering experiment 1964.jpg">File:Thompson scattering experiment 1964.jpg</a> and <a href="/wiki/File:UK_laser_team_off_to_Moscow.jpg" title="File:UK laser team off to Moscow.jpg">File:UK laser team off to Moscow.jpg</a> When were these published?</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>All the items in the first set were part of a press handout that went out shortly after the public annoucement in early 1958.

In the Seattle tunnel, buses and trains share the same <i>raised</i> platform, which allows for level boarding for both low-floor buses and low-floor light rail vehicles; since the buses aren\'t quite made for this kind of setup, the mirrors stick out at head level and have to have strobe lights attached so people aren\'t hit. The tunnel is also operated differently (I assume), with a central control center and signals that prevent buses and trains from getting too close to each other when traveling in the same direction; it\'s not uncommon to see buses and trains stopped in the tunnel approaching a station, waiting for the platform to clear. The tunnel has also been the driver of two unique bus technologies: <a href="/wiki/Dual-mode_bus" title="Dual-mode bus">dual-mode buses</a> that switched to electric overhead wires back when it opened in 1990 (since converted to normal trolleybuses and retired); and hybrid electric buses that switch to electric batteries when operating in the tunnel, which lacks ventilation for diesel buses. <b><a href="/wiki/User:SounderBruce" title="User:SounderBruce"><span style="background:#5d9731; color:white; padding:2px;">Sounder</span></a><a href="/wiki/User_talk:SounderBruce" title="User talk:SounderBruce"><span style="background:#1047AB; color:white; padding:2px;">Bruce</span></a></b> 23:45, 25 July 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>The Toronto buses are also hybrids on a route that formerly had trolley busses (briefly), the trams and buses stop at the same raised platform to allow direct low-floor entry (low-floor trams arrived in the last couple of years), and there is a control booth on the platform controlling signals at the bottom of the ramp that often lead to backups of buses and trams on the ramps. <a href="/wiki/User:Maury_Markowitz" title="User:Maury Markowitz">Maury Markowitz</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Maury_Markowitz" title="User talk:Maury Markowitz">talk</a>) 10:30, 26 July 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Image_review_12">Image review</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Downtown_Seattle_Transit_Tunnel/archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel/archive1">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="/wiki/File:Westlake_Station_DSTT_portal.jpg" title="File:Westlake Station DSTT portal.jpg">File:Westlake Station DSTT portal.jpg</a>: License is fine, is there something particular about this image that justifies its position?</li>\n<li><a href="/wiki/File:Seattle_-_Pioneer_Square_Station_July_2009.jpg" title="File:Seattle - Pioneer Square Station July 2009.jpg">File:Seattle - Pioneer Square Station July 2009.jpg</a>: License and use seem fine for me.</li>\n<li><a href="/wiki/File:Metro_bus_and_Link_light_rail_passing_at_University_Street_Station_(2010).jpg" title="File:Metro bus and Link light rail passing at University Street Station (2010).jpg">File:Metro bus and Link light rail passing at University Street Station (2010).jpg</a>: License and use seem fine for me.</li>\n<li><a href="/wiki/File:Breda_dual-mode_bus_at_Westlake_station_in_Downtown_Seattle_Transit_Tunnel,_9-17-1990.jpg" title="File:Breda dual-mode bus at Westlake station in Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, 9-17-1990.jpg">File:Breda dual-mode bus at Westlake station in Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, 9-17-1990.jpg</a>: License and use seem fine for me.</li>\n<li><a href="/wiki/File:Conventionplacestation3.JPG" title="File:Conventionplacestation3.JPG">File:Conventionplacestation3.JPG</a>: License and use seem fine for me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seems like there is good ALT text. <a href="/wiki/User:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User:Jo-Jo Eumerus">Jo-Jo Eumerus</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus">talk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Special:CentralAuth/Jo-Jo_Eumerus" title="Special:CentralAuth/Jo-Jo Eumerus">contributions</a>) 10:16, 2 August 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>The first image shows the actual tunnel tubes, which I deem important enough for the infobox.

A couple of quick thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worth giving it a scrub for metric/imperial equivalents.</li>\n<li>Also worth checking for abbreviations, e.g "when this wasn\'t feasible"</li>\n<li>And for underlinking (e.g. "Springfield breech loading rifle" could be usefully linked)</li>\n<li>And check that each reference is in a consistent style (e.g. do you give just publisher, or location and publisher etc.)</li>\n<li>My main issue is the use of the newspapers of the period as reliable secondary sources. In some cases, you\'re carefully attributing the information to the newspaper, which makes clear that it\'s not a statement that\'s been reviewed by a modern historian, but a contemporary piece of press reporting ("On July 26, The Sun reported 3,000 draymen, 600 oil men, and 1,500 stevedores out of work as a result of the embargo.") We don\'t really know if this is accurate or not, but it is clear that it is a newspaper statement. In other cases, a newspaper account is listed as fact, e.g. "There was a general hope that owing to the imminent increase in traffic due to the transportation of harvested crops, the fireman would be able to make daily trips, and that the company could arrange for them to return home on passenger trains when this wasn\'t feasible, which would save them from the burden of long layovers away from home." I\'d be strongly advising an article on labour disputes in the 19th century to be drawing whenever possible on reliable modern academic sources, and to be extremely scrupulous about attributing any press material to the newspaper concerned. (WP:PRIMARY would apply here).</li>\n<li>Images look generally fine, but I note that&#160;:File:Great Railroad Strike plaque, Baltimore 01 (cropped).jpg is justified by "Marker placed by the Maryland Historical Trust, who retains neither copyright for the physical representation of the marker nor the text." - I can\'t see any explanation for why this should be the case.

Stover, Stowell, and Laurie feature most prominently among modern sources, with a combined 20 citations. The heaviest reliance on period news (where there is not also concurrent secondary citation) is in the sections following the end of open violence, because most of the sources start to drop off in detail at this point, and move on to the "exciting stuff" elsewhere, namely things like burning half of Pittsburgh to the ground (see <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh_railway_riots" title="Pittsburgh railway riots">Pittsburgh railway riots</a>), and don\'t really concern themselves with things like the price of cabbage or how many idle ships are in the harbor.\n<dl>\n<dd>Part of the problem with nineteenth century sources is their tendency to exaggerate. Such sentences as <span class="example good-example" style="font-family: Georgia, \'DejaVu Serif\', serif; color: #006400;">The first parade of the 5th Regiment through the city following the crisis was on October 15. They marched that day with 400 counted among their ranks</span> could be adjusted with some judicious qualifications: "On 15 October, the 5th Regiment\'s first post-crisis parade included (according to contemporary accounts) 400 men of the regiment." This way you document what the contemporary sources say without giving them undue weight. <a href="/wiki/User:Auntieruth55" title="User:Auntieruth55">auntieruth</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Auntieruth55" title="User talk:Auntieruth55">(talk)</a> 21:34, 9 July 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n<dd>To the content issues, I can try to work on those after the next few days, and maybe start digging back through the state archives and other sources.

The only exception is the derailed train where the fireman and engineer were injured. The presumption is more-or-less that because these two are mentioned, they were the only casualties. It was likely not a passenger train. Certainly passenger rail was widely used, but in these industrial centers, the unrest was centered around freight, since the prices for the selling and transportation of freight was the volatile bit that was exposed to the fluctuations of the depression, and caused the problems to begin with. In some cities (like Pittsburgh), there was even early resumption of mail and passenger services as an olive branch from the strikers. <a href="/wiki/User:Timothyjosephwood" title="User:Timothyjosephwood"><span style="color:#a56d3f;font-family:Impact;">Timothy</span><span style="color:#6f3800;font-family:Impact;">Joseph</span><span style="color:#422501;font-family:Impact;">Wood</span></a> 13:42, 18 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Struck my oppose.

I suspect it should be: "The Sun reported that, between the 30th and August 1, the strikers who still held out".</li>\n<li>Not necessary for FA, but it would be nice to figure out a link target for the 6th, 7th, and 8th regiments, even if it\'s a redlink.</li>\n<li>The authorization of the 8th regiment is mentioned in passing as being new, but if it\'s in direct response to the rioting then I think that should be clearly stated.

One reason for this was that it was only created in October 1946, with Tizard as the departmental scientific advisor." I do not understand this, although this may be because I have forgotten something you said earlier in the article. You say in the lead that the decision to launch the project was taken in January 1947, and it came under the Ministry of Supply. DNB on Tizard says he returned to Whitehall as chairman of the defence research policy committee in January 1947, but the committee was debarred from discussing nuclear weapons. So are you saying that the Ministry of Defence was excluded because it was considered too new to take responsibility for nuclear weapons, and because Tizard was regarded as an opponent of them?\n<dl>\n<dd>Tizard was appointed the CSA to the MOD in November 1946. He became chairman of the DPRC in January 1947. I have elaborated on this. <a href="/wiki/User:Hawkeye7" title="User:Hawkeye7"><span style="color:#9933ff">Hawkeye7</span></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hawkeye7" title="User talk:Hawkeye7"><span style="font-size:80%">(talk)</span></a> 00:34, 22 August 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li>"The possession of nuclear reactors, the means to produce nuclear fuels and a repository of scientific knowledge led to the creation of a vast nuclear power industry." No change needed, but I have seen it argued that nuclear power was based on uranium instead to the safer thorium because thorium reactors would not produce fuel for bombs. Do you give any credence to this claim?\n<dl>\n<dd>Thorium was of interest in the early days because it was known to be abundant, whereas uranium was thought to be scarce. But once uranium became valuable, people started prospecting for it, and it was found to be not nearly as rare as first thought. The idea was that thorium can be irradiated to produce uranium-233, which is fissile, and can therefore be used in a reactor. Like plutonium, you first need to have a reactor to produce it. You can then breed more uranium-233 from thorium than you consume. This can be attractive to a country like India, which has plenty of thorium but not much uranium. For the rest of us though, it is far more convenient to breed plutonium from uranium-238, because uranium-233 has nasty decay products that are powerful gamma ray emitters, and it is therefore more difficult to handle than plutonium. Uranium-233 can be used in bombs; India has done so, and the Americans once built a bomb using uranium-233, just to show that they could. <a href="/wiki/User:Hawkeye7" title="User:Hawkeye7"><span style="color:#9933ff">Hawkeye7</span></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Hawkeye7" title="User talk:Hawkeye7"><span style="font-size:80%">(talk)</span></a> 00:34, 22 August 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A first rate article, although much of it is beyond my knowledge to judge. <a href="/wiki/User:Dudley_Miles" title="User:Dudley Miles">Dudley Miles</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dudley_Miles" title="User talk:Dudley Miles">talk</a>) 22:07, 21 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n<li><b>Support</b>. <a href="/wiki/User:Dudley_Miles" title="User:Dudley Miles">Dudley Miles</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dudley_Miles" title="User talk:Dudley Miles">talk</a>) 09:34, 22 August 2017 (UTC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Support</b> by <a href="/wiki/User:Peacemaker67" title="User:Peacemaker67">Peacemaker67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Peacemaker67" title="User talk:Peacemaker67">click to talk to me</a>) 04:35, 16 August 2017 (UTC) I reviewed this article at GAN and again at Milhist ACR and have reviewed all the changes made since then, and consider that it meets the FA criteria. <a href="/wiki/User:Peacemaker67" title="User:Peacemaker67">Peacemaker67</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Peacemaker67" title="User talk:Peacemaker67">click to talk to me</a>) 04:35, 16 August 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<p><b>Coordinator comment</b>: Unless I\'ve missed it somewhere, we still need a source review.

Her peyote session resulted in the "allegorical" drawing of sex between two keeling nudes that was responsible for Berman\'s arrest and the closing of his Ferrus Gallery exhibition."

I can\'t reliably identify Cameron, but I think there are at least two close-ups of her face in the trailer (one in a veil, one with maniacal laughter), and likely many more in the full film if its PD status can be confirmed. <a href="/wiki/User:J_Milburn" title="User:J Milburn">Josh Milburn</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:J_Milburn" title="User talk:J Milburn">talk</a>) 18:38, 16 July 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>I\'ve uploaded <a href="/wiki/File:Marjorie_Cameron_in_Night_Tide.jpg" title="File:Marjorie Cameron in Night Tide.jpg">File:Marjorie Cameron in Night Tide.jpg</a> and <a href="/wiki/File:Marjorie_Cameron_in_Night_Tide_(cropped).jpg" title="File:Marjorie Cameron in Night Tide (cropped).jpg">File:Marjorie Cameron in Night Tide (cropped).jpg</a>, in case that\'s a shot you\'d be happy to use. <a href="/wiki/User:J_Milburn" title="User:J Milburn">Josh Milburn</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:J_Milburn" title="User talk:J Milburn">talk</a>) 18:51, 16 July 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Hmm... the quality of the image is pretty low.

It\'d be hard to prove, though. By the way, there are some valuable-looking sources listed <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cameron-parsons.org/media.html">here</a>.

I have seen this done to good effect on other articles about artists, as it means that the lead serves to identify both the person and their artwork. Given that you are already using Cameron\'s self-portrait, this could be a viable option. A screenshot (such as the one I have already uploaded) could then be used in the article body for the purposes of visual interest. <a href="/wiki/User:J_Milburn" title="User:J Milburn">Josh Milburn</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:J_Milburn" title="User talk:J Milburn">talk</a>) 21:19, 8 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>That could certainly work if her portraits were highly realistic, but in a case like this, where her works are a little bit more \'abstract\' (if that\'s the right word), I\'m not sure if it would. <a href="/wiki/User:Midnightblueowl" title="User:Midnightblueowl">Midnightblueowl</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Midnightblueowl" title="User talk:Midnightblueowl">talk</a>) 12:33, 21 August 2017 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Source_review_by_Wehwalt">Source review by Wehwalt</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Marjorie_Cameron/archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-5" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Marjorie Cameron/archive1">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>All sources seem of encyclopedic quality and are consistently cited.

My guess is, since the third movie was filmed in 2005 and the first one in 1999, which is indeed six real-life years apart, is the reason for this continuity error.</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>"roller coaster derailment" It\'d be ugly, but that\'s a <a href="/wiki/Compound_adjective" class="mw-redirect" title="Compound adjective">compound adjective</a>, so it should be "roller-coaster derailment".

It looks like all the newspapers/magazines are italicised, which is good, but there seems to be some inconsistency on the web-only sources. The MOS is pretty unhelpful on this: "Website titles may or may not be italicized depending on the type of site and what kind of content it features. Online magazines, newspapers, and news sites with original content should generally be italicized (Salon or HuffPost). Online encyclopedias and dictionaries should also be italicized (Scholarpedia or Merriam-Webster Online). Other types of websites should be decided on a case-by-case basis." Not only is this vague, but it isn\'t followed in practice (no one italicises the name of <i>this</i> online encyclopedia, for example). I suppose I would just like to see you adopt a consistent style. Just one example (and this is just one; I\'m not saying "here\'s the problem I want you to fix"): are you italicising Metacritic or not? You don\'t in the article proper, you do in the references. As above: If you would italicise in the article, italicise in the refs. If you wouldn\'t italicise in the article, don\'t italicise in the refs. <a href="/wiki/MOS:ITALICTITLE" class="mw-redirect" title="MOS:ITALICTITLE">MOS:ITALICTITLE</a> may be helpful, but it only goes so far. <a href="/wiki/User:J_Milburn" title="User:J Milburn">Josh Milburn</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:J_Milburn" title="User talk:J Milburn">talk</a>) 21:48, 22 August 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Having just typed that, part of me wants to say "to hell with it, life\'s too short".

The link should go directly to the content that supports the information. If for some reason the site cannot do that, you need to make that clear in the citation that the reader needs to do an additional step to verify the content. I can\'t know I need to do soemthing if the citation does not tell me that. Whether Rotten Tomatoes "approves" a critic doesn\'t necessarily make a source a high quality one. Just because the government of Canada partially funds something doesn\'t make it high quality - I don\'t automatically trust anything "partially funded" by the US government either. In every case where I question something, I went to the site, I hunted around for an about page (which in many cases I listed above...) and only after failing to find something that showed high quality did I question it. It\'s not a hopeless situation - I didn\'t feel that everything was so clearly not-reliable that I opposed the article - but there ARE issues with the sourcing - using stock photos to source information is just not going to work, it doesn\'t even meet the basic standards of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>, much less the higher standard at FAC.

Famously described by brother Carl as "a bunt instead of a grand slam", <i>Smiley Smile</i> was produced DIY-style at Brian\'s makeshift home studio with the core set-up of a detuned piano, bass guitar, and theatre organ. The songs range from drugged-out singalongs to creepy dissonance and far-off background noise.</p>\n<p>Coinciding with highly ambitious efforts like the Beatles\' <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> and Pink Floyd\'s <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i>, the majority of critics and fans who were promised another masterwork on the level of "<a href="/wiki/Good_Vibrations" title="Good Vibrations">Good Vibrations</a>" didn\'t know what to make of the album\'s goofy doo-wop chants and marijuana ambiance. The record came and went, and the Beach Boys were soon rejected by the maturing youth market as washed-up surf-pop relics. As the legend goes, Wilson <a href="/wiki/Brian_Wilson#Recluse_period" title="Brian Wilson">retreated to his bed and spent the ensuing years snorting cocaine</a>. <i>Smiley Smile</i> has since earned a considerable cult following, particularly among enthusiasts of indie/outsider music. --<a href="/wiki/User:Ilovetopaint" title="User:Ilovetopaint">Ilovetopaint</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ilovetopaint" title="User talk:Ilovetopaint">talk</a>) 13:06, 2 June 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Comments_by_Bruce1ee">Comments by Bruce1ee</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Smiley_Smile/archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-2" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Smiley Smile/archive1">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>I\'ve made several minor edits to the article <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smiley_Smile&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=783460270&amp;oldid=783459815">here</a>, <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smiley_Smile&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=783464698&amp;oldid=783460352">here</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smiley_Smile&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=783607690&amp;oldid=783563392">here</a>; these are my comments:</p>\n<p>Lead</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No mention is made in the lead of Brian\'s creative role in the Beach Boys\' music, and in particular the <i>Smile</i> project; statements like "Following Brian Wilson\'s declaration that most of the <i>Smile</i> tapes were off-limits" and "Its production was unusually credited to "the Beach Boys" rather than Brian alone" will puzzle the uninitiated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Background</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carl Wilson\'s quote explains how <i>Smiley Smile</i> came about (a homespun version of <i>Smile</i>) \xe2\x80\x93 it comes across to me as an afterthought; I feel there should be a direct statement in this section explaining what led to <i>Smiley Smile</i>.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>The paragraphs before kinda already serve that function ("I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things, such big musical things.

I see you\'ve also done some quite substantial rewrites of some of the sections. One question about the picture caption of the group in Central Park: how do you know they\'re performing "Heroes and Villains"?

All of these are on YouTube. "Heroes" is the only performance that matches the photo, with Al, Mike, and Carl each singing at the same time, Mike standing still with the tambourine at his side, the positions of the backup players, and so forth. They couldn\'t be playing "Good Vibrations" because Mike was on theremin for that, and on "I Get Around" he didn\'t have a tambourine, etc. --<a href="/wiki/User:Ilovetopaint" title="User:Ilovetopaint">Ilovetopaint</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ilovetopaint" title="User talk:Ilovetopaint">talk</a>) 11:03, 6 June 2017 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Then that caption should have a source \xe2\x80\x93 as it stands it comes across as <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOR">original research</a>.

The major reamining problem is sourcing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7 times: Riley, Lisa (March 26, 2008). "Assata Shakur". The Langston University Gazette.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>4 times Churchill and Vander Wall, 2002</li>\n<li>Paul Wolf\'s word doc on COINTELPRO</li>\n<li>14 times Kirsta, Alix (May 29, 1999), "A black and white case \xe2\x80\x93 Investigation \xe2\x80\x93 Joanne Chesimard". The Times.</li>\n<li>6 times Williams, Evelyn A. (June 25, 2005). "Statement of Facts in the New Jersey trial of Assata Shakur". The Talking Drum Collective.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Riley is not an RS, just an undergraduate newspaper from a disreputable university. Churchill was fired by Colorado for acadmic misconduct, so a better source needed. I have read Kirsta\'s article, she doesn\'t seem to have reread the trial transcript or anything, mostly just parrots AS\'s supporters claims uncritically. Deserves some weight but citing 14 times is over the top. Wolf is not RS. Williams is AS\'s aunt and lawyer. Should not be used for statements in wikipedia\'s voice.</p>\n<p>The overall problem with this article is the problem mentioned by Burrough - most of the stuff on AS is either skimpy press clippings from the 1970s or nonRS advocacy from AS\'s supporters who recycle the same claims endlessly. Unfortunately Burrough\'s book does not rectify this in his brief mentions of AS. Trying to write a FA on AS with the lack of good sourcing is an uphill battle. <a href="/wiki/User:NPalgan2" title="User:NPalgan2">NPalgan2</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:NPalgan2" title="User talk:NPalgan2">talk</a>) 21:28, 10 August 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tahirih_Justice_Center"><a href="/wiki/Tahirih_Justice_Center" title="Tahirih Justice Center">Tahirih Justice Center</a></span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_review/Tahirih_Justice_Center/archive1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-1" title="Wikipedia:Featured article review/Tahirih Justice Center/archive1">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<dl>\n<dd><small><i>Notified: <a href="/wiki/User_talk:DrFleischman" title="User talk:DrFleischman">DrFleischman</a>, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Finnusertop" title="User talk:Finnusertop">Finnusertop</a>, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:UberCryxic" title="User talk:UberCryxic">UberCryxic</a>, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jeff3000" title="User talk:Jeff3000">Jeff3000</a>, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:PumpkinSky" title="User talk:PumpkinSky">PumpkinSky</a>, <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Kirill_Lokshin" title="User talk:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Human_rights" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Human rights">WikiProject Human rights</a></i></small></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>I am nominating this featured article for review because the issues raised at <a href="/wiki/Talk:Tahirih_Justice_Center#Featured_article_review" title="Talk:Tahirih Justice Center">Talk:Tahirih Justice Center#Featured article review</a> do not appear to have been resolved, and maintenance banners have been in place since September 2014.

Several years ago, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Firefly_episodes" class="mw-redirect" title="List of Firefly episodes">List of Firefly episodes</a> was merged into this article. Currently, the episode summaries are not comprehensive, and I expect most readers to look through the whole episode list. However, the series itself lasted just one season, yet it achieved the cult status. It even spanned the film <i>Serenity</i>. Also, there has been additional content over the years, such as "Media franchise". The sources should be re-evaluated, including dead links. While there have been edits, most of them this year were just housekeeping cleanups. The issues were discussed at the article talk page early this year, and they should be re-discussed here. Therefore, I hope people interested can improve this article. --<a href="/wiki/User:George_Ho" title="User:George Ho">George Ho</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:George_Ho" title="User talk:George Ho">talk</a>) 21:55, 6 June 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<p>Also, those who promoted the article and contributed to the article at the time of the 2006 nomination may be inactive at this time, so I notified ones who recently contributed to the article instead.

"Particularly notable is the "duel of the songs" between Strasser and Laszlo at Rick\'s cafe" - particularly notable according to whom?), and \'Quotations\' section seems like a wikiquote-artifact. There are also expected minor problems with inconsistent citation styles and at least two books donn\'t cite page range (Eco (1986) and Eco (1994)).

Since nobody even so much as replied there, I am forced to escalate to here, since it seems unlikely anyone is interested in fixing those problems. <sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="/wiki/User:Piotrus" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a>| <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Piotrus" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">reply here</font></a></sub> 03:20, 25 April 2017 (UTC)</p>\n<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="FARC_section_3">FARC section</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_review/Casablanca_(film)/archive2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=T-3" title="Wikipedia:Featured article review/Casablanca (film)/archive2">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>Issues raised in the review section include structure, prose, and referencing. <a href="/wiki/User:Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Nikkimaria" title="User talk:Nikkimaria">talk</a>) 15:36, 3 June 2017*** (UTC)</i></dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Keep</b>.
