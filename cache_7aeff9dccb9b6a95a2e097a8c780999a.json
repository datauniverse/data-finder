NBC programmer Tracy McLaughlin suggested <a href="/wiki/Paul_Giamatti" title="Paul Giamatti">Paul Giamatti</a> to producer <a href="/wiki/Ben_Silverman" title="Ben Silverman">Ben Silverman</a> for the role of Michael Scott, but the actor declined. <a href="/wiki/Martin_Short" title="Martin Short">Martin Short</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hank_Azaria" title="Hank Azaria">Hank Azaria</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bob_Odenkirk" title="Bob Odenkirk">Bob Odenkirk</a> were also reported to be interested.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> In January 2004, <i><a href="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> reported Steve Carell of the popular <a href="/wiki/Comedy_Central" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a> program <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Show_with_Jon_Stewart" class="mw-redirect" title="The Daily Show with Jon Stewart">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a></i>, was in talks to play the role. At the time, he was already committed to another NBC midseason replacement comedy, <i>Come to Papa</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Due to Carell being unavailable, <a href="/wiki/Bob_Odenkirk" title="Bob Odenkirk">Bob Odenkirk</a> was selected as Michael Scott and was part of the cast presented to NBC executives.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> However, <i>Come to Papa</i> was quickly canceled, allowing Carell to commit to <i>The Office</i>. Carell later stated he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the British series before he auditioned. He did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying Gervais\' characterizations. On the audio commentary of The Pilot episode, director Ken Kwapis says that Carell\'s unfamiliarity with the British version of <i>The Office</i> and their experience working together on <i><a href="/wiki/Watching_Ellie" title="Watching Ellie">Watching Ellie</a></i> influenced his being cast as Scott.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Two supporting roles in films helped get the attention of audiences: <i><a href="/wiki/Bruce_Almighty" title="Bruce Almighty">Bruce Almighty</a></i>, in which Carell plays Evan Baxter (an arrogant rival to <a href="/wiki/Jim_Carrey" title="Jim Carrey">Jim Carrey</a>\'s character), who gets a humorous comeuppance while co-anchoring the news. In <i><a href="/wiki/Anchorman:_The_Legend_of_Ron_Burgundy" title="Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy">Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</a></i>, Carell plays another news personality, as slow-witted weatherman Brick Tamland. Although the series premiered to mediocre ratings, <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> renewed it for another season because of the anticipated success of Carell\'s movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_40-Year-Old_Virgin" title="The 40-Year-Old Virgin">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-Chicago_Tribune_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Chicago_Tribune-6">[6]</a></sup> and the show subsequently became a ratings success. Carell won a <a href="/wiki/Golden_Globe" class="mw-redirect" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Television_Critics_Association" title="Television Critics Association">Television Critics Association</a> award in 2006 for his role. He also received <a href="/wiki/Emmy" class="mw-redirect" title="Emmy">Emmy</a> nominations in 2006, 2007 and 2011 for his work in the series. Although <i>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</i> was a surprise success, Carell revealed in an interview with <i><a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> that he had no plans to leave <i>The Office</i>. However, on the <a href="/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live" title="BBC Radio 5 Live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> Film Review show, he stated in an interview that his time on the show would probably end after his contract ran out after Season 7.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> This was later confirmed on June 28, 2010, when Carell confirmed that the seventh season of the show was to be his last after his contract with NBC expired.</p>\n<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Character_Information.2C_Arc.2C_and_Backstory">Character Information, Arc, and Backstory</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Character Information, Arc, and Backstory">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Biography">Biography</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Michael\'s hometown is also Scranton, Pennsylvania.

In "<a href="/wiki/Nepotism_(The_Office)" title="Nepotism (The Office)">Nepotism</a>", it is revealed that Michael had a half-sister, from whom he was estranged from 1995 through 2010. As a consequence of their reunion, Michael hires his nephew Luke as an intern for the office, but eventually confronts the incompetent and rude Luke and ends up spanking him in front of the office, leading Luke to burst into tears and quit.</p>\n<p>In the episode "<a href="/wiki/Take_Your_Daughter_to_Work_Day_(The_Office)" title="Take Your Daughter to Work Day (The Office)">Take Your Daughter to Work Day</a>", Michael makes the claim that he was a child star on a kids\' show called <i>Fundle Bundle;</i> however, it becomes clear that he simply appeared on the show as one of many guest children who usually watched from home. In the old recording being played, he speaks touchingly about what he wanted when he grew up: get married, have "100 kids" so he could then have "100 friends" and none of them could say no to being his friend. Michael did not attend college, having lost all his tuition money in a <a href="/wiki/Pyramid_scheme" title="Pyramid scheme">pyramid scheme</a>.</p>\n<p>He was hired as a salesman at Dunder Mifflin in the 1990s, where he proved to be extremely effective. Dwight praised him in a deleted scene from "<a href="/wiki/The_Coup_(The_Office)" title="The Coup (The Office)">The Coup</a>" for winning consecutive awards for best salesman. In "<a href="/wiki/Two_Weeks_(The_Office)" title="Two Weeks (The Office)">Two Weeks</a>", he claims to have acquired half of the Scranton branch client base. In "<a href="/wiki/The_Client_(The_Office)" title="The Client (The Office)">The Client</a>", he impresses his then-manager, <a href="/wiki/Jan_Levinson-Gould" class="mw-redirect" title="Jan Levinson-Gould">Jan Levinson-Gould</a>, by singlehandedly acquiring an important client through somewhat unorthodox methods. Both <a href="/wiki/Pam_Halpert" class="mw-redirect" title="Pam Halpert">Pam Halpert</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ryan_Howard_(The_Office)" title="Ryan Howard (The Office)">Ryan Howard</a> are impressed watching him make sales and negotiate their contracts when working in The Michael Scott Paper Company. Even <a href="/wiki/Jim_Halpert" title="Jim Halpert">Jim Halpert</a> concedes that he might never become as good a salesman as Michael in "<a href="/wiki/Koi_Pond_(The_Office)" title="Koi Pond (The Office)">Koi Pond</a>".</p>\n<p>The skills that made him successful as a salesman, however, are not effective when applied to managerial duties and Michael is shown to be ill-suited to that position, injecting a lot of his personal feelings into the work environment. During a candid conversation in "<a href="/wiki/The_Fire_(The_Office)" title="The Fire (The Office)">The Fire</a>", Michael tells Ryan that he became a salesman because he loved to make friends and, after being promoted to regional manager at a young age, continued to treat work-related relationships as personal friendships which he acknowledges is more difficult because his colleagues are all lower than him in the workplace\'s hierarchy. He seems to have few relationships outside the office. In his interactions with other characters, he is shallow, callous, ignorant and unaware of basic social norms. He tends to overestimate his own importance in the eyes of his co-workers and cannot understand why they do not seem to have much fun at work, as he believes an office to be the "place where dreams come true." However, Michael is somewhat loyal to the company and honestly tries to help his employees when he thinks they are having a problem. Michael has been at Dunder Mifflin (as of "Michael\'s Last Dundies") 9,986,000 minutes, meaning he would have been working at Dunder Mifflin since May 6, 1992.</p>\n<p>Michael\'s constant desire to be the center of attention often manifests itself in selfish behavior. For example, when he burns his foot in "<a href="/wiki/The_Injury" title="The Injury">The Injury</a>", he expects Pam and Ryan to tend to his needs, despite Dwight\'s much more serious concussion. When invited to be an usher in "<a href="/wiki/Phyllis%27_Wedding" title="Phyllis\' Wedding">Phyllis\' Wedding</a>", he assumes that his participation will be the high point of the ceremony and pouts when he is upstaged by Phyllis\' elderly father, eventually giving an insulting and overly familiar toast that gets him banned from the reception altogether. His desire to be liked often leads him to make unwise decisions or unfeasible promises without considering the consequences, only to back out when they result in an undesirable comeuppance. Michael appears to emphasize moments of sympathy or civility directed at him by his co-workers (mostly Jim) and inflates their importance in order to compensate for his loneliness.</p>\n<p>Michael is irresponsible with his finances, and at one point is so heavily in debt he has to take up a second job as a <a href="/wiki/Telemarketing" title="Telemarketing">telemarketer</a>. Oscar makes a chart of Michael\'s spending habits and chides him for spending too much money on things "nobody ever needs" like multiple <a href="/wiki/Magic_sets" class="mw-redirect" title="Magic sets">magic sets</a> and professional <a href="/wiki/Bass_fishing" title="Bass fishing">bass fishing</a> equipment. Eventually, Michael is forced to <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy" title="Bankruptcy">declare bankruptcy</a> (which he thinks requires only standing up and shouting "I declare bankruptcy!")</p>\n<p>Due to his overall lack of common sense, Michael can withstand significant abuse from his peers and is often the butt of jokes. He is quick to take offense when he realizes he is being wronged and his response is often disproportionate to the harm suffered; similarly, he tends to unintentionally offend people, but will usually sincerely apologize on the rare occasion that he realizes he has inadvertently insulted someone, the most notable example being in "<a href="/wiki/Gay_Witch_Hunt" title="Gay Witch Hunt">Gay Witch Hunt</a>" when he cries upon realizing his use of the term "faggy" hurt Oscar\'s feelings. Even though he is generally oblivious to criticism, derision and sarcasm, Michael has some limits to his patience, and leaves to question the extent of offense that he can actually acknowledge (demanding professional respect from <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Hudson" title="Stanley Hudson">Stanley Hudson</a> in "<a href="/wiki/Did_I_Stutter%3F" title="Did I Stutter?">Did I Stutter?</a>" or standing up to the employees in favor of Holly in "<a href="/wiki/Business_Ethics_(The_Office)" title="Business Ethics (The Office)">Business Ethics</a>").</p>\n<p>In "<a href="/wiki/The_Meeting_(The_Office)" title="The Meeting (The Office)">The Meeting</a>", it is shown that Michael does not aim for his employees\' betterment or his own, thinking that this would put his job at jeopardy; he unwittingly turns down a promotion that would put Jim in his position, choosing the <a href="/wiki/Status_quo" title="Status quo">status quo</a> over his employees\' ambitions, and sabotaging Jim with a bad recommendation because he mistakenly believes that Jim\'s promotion to his job would lead to his firing. He does, however, concede to a co-managerial position with Jim to avoid losing him.</p>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interests">Interests</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Interests">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Michael\'s catchphrase is "<a href="/wiki/That%27s_what_she_said" class="mw-redirect" title="That\'s what she said">That\'s what <i>she</i> said!</a>", a sexually suggestive <a href="/wiki/Double_entendre" title="Double entendre">double entendre</a> he uses even in the most inappropriate circumstances, including business meetings and legal depositions.

Song parody writing is often referred to: in "<a href="/wiki/Goodbye,_Toby" title="Goodbye, Toby">Goodbye, Toby</a>", he relates the titles of two of his songs, <a href="/wiki/Tears_in_Heaven" title="Tears in Heaven">"Beers in Heaven"</a> and <a href="/wiki/Total_Eclipse_of_the_Heart" title="Total Eclipse of the Heart">"Total Eclipse of the Fart"</a>, before singing a rendition of "<a href="/wiki/Goodbye_Stranger" title="Goodbye Stranger">Goodbye Stranger</a>" as a departing gesture to Toby. He performs his parody of "<a href="/wiki/The_Chanukah_Song" title="The Chanukah Song">The Chanukah Song</a>" to reflect the <a href="/wiki/Diwali_(The_Office)" title="Diwali (The Office)">Diwali</a> celebration Kelly invites Michael to. In <a href="/wiki/Dream_Team_(The_Office)" title="Dream Team (The Office)">Dream Team</a>, he comes up with "Achey Breaky Fart" and "My Stumps" during a brainstorming exercise. He hopes to finish the video production of his script, "Threat Level: Midnight", whose script was found and read by the office and whose finished movie (after ten years of production) was viewed in the seventh season episode of the same name.</p>\n<p>He adores the theatrical stylings of <a href="/wiki/Meryl_Streep" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a>, describing her in "<a href="/wiki/The_Job_(The_Office)" title="The Job (The Office)">The Job</a>" as the "best actor around," and mimics her character from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film)" title="The Devil Wears Prada (film)">The Devil Wears Prada</a></i> after seeing the film. He adores Wikipedia and <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>, although he doesn\'t seem to really understand how they work and believes them to be news media organizations. Michael also likes the music of <a href="/wiki/Billy_Joel" title="Billy Joel">Billy Joel</a>, the movies <i><a href="/wiki/Mean_Girls" title="Mean Girls">Mean Girls</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Million_Dollar_Baby" title="Million Dollar Baby">Million Dollar Baby</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Die_Hard" title="Die Hard">Die Hard</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/What_a_Girl_Wants_(film)" title="What a Girl Wants (film)"><i>What a girl wants</i></a>, and television series such as <i><a href="/wiki/ALF_(TV_series)" title="ALF (TV series)">ALF</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Entourage_(U.S._TV_series)" title="Entourage (U.S. TV series)">Entourage</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_L_Word" title="The L Word">The L Word</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Queer_as_Folk_(U.S._TV_series)" title="Queer as Folk (U.S. TV series)">Queer as Folk</a></i>. Michael tends to be a bit "behind" when it comes to popular culture references, such as when he refers to his then-girlfriend Jan\'s youthful male assistant as "<a href="/wiki/James_Van_Der_Beek" title="James Van Der Beek">James Van Der Beek</a>" or in his numerous ringtones, including "My Humps," "Mambo Number Five" and "Salt N Pepa."</p>\n<p>He appears to have a history of playing <a href="/wiki/Ice_hockey" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> and demonstrates his talent in "<a href="/wiki/Michael%27s_Birthday" title="Michael\'s Birthday">Michael\'s Birthday</a>", and mentions in "<a href="/wiki/Dream_Team_(The_Office)" title="Dream Team (The Office)">Dream Team</a>" that in high school, after his math teacher told him he was going to flunk out, he went out the next day and "scored more goals than anyone in the history of the hockey team." He also has invited potential clients to "<a href="/wiki/Wilkes-Barre/Scranton_Penguins" title="Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins">Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins</a>" games. On multiple occasions, Michael has also expressed interest in <a href="/wiki/Basketball" title="Basketball">basketball</a> even though he is terrible at it (in "<a href="/wiki/The_Fire_(The_Office)" title="The Fire (The Office)">The Fire</a>", "<a href="/wiki/Basketball_(The_Office)" title="Basketball (The Office)">Basketball</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael" title="Goodbye, Michael">Goodbye, Michael</a>"). Michael is a Pittsburgh Pirates fan, and does not like the New York Mets. This appears in episode 6 season 1, when he is on a phone call with Jan Levinson-Gould. In addition, He has also been shown wearing a <i><a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates" title="Pittsburgh Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a></i> cap.</p>\n<p>Other interests include a pair of Levi\'s he refers to as his "fun jeans", which he has professionally dry cleaned and likely instituted Casual Friday for, according to Pam, in "<a href="/wiki/The_Convention_(The_Office)" title="The Convention (The Office)">The Convention</a>", his self-bought "World\'s Best Boss" mug he bought at <a href="/wiki/Spencer_Gifts" title="Spencer Gifts">Spencer Gifts</a>, that he has duplicates of, and <a href="/wiki/Chrysler" title="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> automobiles. He drives a silver 2004 <a href="/wiki/Chrysler_Sebring" title="Chrysler Sebring">Sebring convertible</a> for the first three seasons until he trades it in with Jan\'s Volvo for a shared <a href="/wiki/Porsche_Boxster" class="mw-redirect" title="Porsche Boxster">Porsche Boxster</a> in the episode "<a href="/wiki/Money_(The_Office)" title="Money (The Office)">Money</a>". After their relationship, he drives a red <a href="/wiki/Chrysler_PT_Cruiser" title="Chrysler PT Cruiser">PT Cruiser convertible</a> and later a newer-model Sebring as a benefit of the buyout of the Michael Scott Paper Company to Dunder Mifflin in "<a href="/wiki/Broke_(The_Office)" title="Broke (The Office)">Broke</a>". Michael enjoys planning fantasy entrepreneurial schemes that he would like to start, such as a men\'s shoe store called "Shoe La La", or another paper company simply called "Michael".</p>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality_and_management_style">Personality and management style</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Personality and management style">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Apart from his masterful salesmanship, Michael is lacking in almost any other skills, management or otherwise. Co-manager <a href="/wiki/Jim_Halpert" title="Jim Halpert">Jim Halpert</a> once made a color graph of how Michael spends his time: 80% "distracting others," 19% "procrastination," and 1% "critical thinking", and added that he inflated the "critical thinking" percentage so people could actually see it on the graph. His laid-back approach more often results in lower than expected workplace productivity, particularly when Michael places his personal interests as a priority over work (such as his birthday, someone else\'s birthday, or his various seminars). To avoid being disciplined for his foolish actions, Michael often resorts to <a href="/wiki/Scapegoating" title="Scapegoating">scapegoating</a> employees to cover himself. Although his actions often lead to more problems for his employees, Michael believes that Scranton is "the cool, fun branch... like <i><a href="/wiki/Animal_House" title="Animal House">Animal House</a></i>," and is genuinely upset when the top salesman from the Utica office trashes Scranton in a phone call by saying it\'s "worse than <a href="/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey" title="Camden, New Jersey">Camden</a>".</p>\n<p>Although his position as Regional Manager gives him broad decision-making authority on branch operations, he often places those responsibilities secondary to his desire to be friends with his employees. On the other hand, he also oversteps his authority by hosting events that Corporate disapproves of, such as <a href="/wiki/The_Dundies" title="The Dundies">The Dundies</a> and <a href="/wiki/Booze_Cruise_(The_Office)" title="Booze Cruise (The Office)">a booze cruise</a>.</p>\n<p>It is revealed in the episode "<a href="/wiki/The_Duel_(The_Office)" title="The Duel (The Office)">The Duel</a>" that, despite Michael\'s incompetence, the Scranton branch is the best-performing company branch, well ahead of Utica and Nashua. Michael is called to Corporate to answer the question, "What are you doing right?" After several minutes of Michael\'s inarticulate babble, his superiors concede that while Michael is definitely doing something right, they will probably never know exactly what. They send him on a lecture tour for Michael to spread his wisdom; instead, he wastes time and annoys the workers who have to listen to his drivel.</p>\n<p>Despite his apparent ineptitude, Michael is prone to brief bouts of surprising insight and is shown to have a kind heart as he shows deep, family-like affection towards most of the people working for him in the Scranton branch. The staff initially finds Michael annoying but he grows on them and is given emotional goodbyes during his final days in Scranton. In the episode "<a href="/wiki/Broke_(The_Office)" title="Broke (The Office)">Broke</a>", Michael displays self-awareness of his inability to keep secrets when he, Pam and Ryan all agree not to let Dunder Mifflin know that the Michael Scott Paper Company is broke, yet moments later he is seen bent over and in a near panic when he admits that he\'s afraid he won\'t be able to keep himself from letting the truth slip. Later in the same episode, he displays a remarkable ability to negotiate with Dunder Mifflin and convince the company to hire himself as well as Pam and Ryan back with full benefits.</p>\n<p>In the episode "<a href="/wiki/Business_School_(The_Office)" title="Business School (The Office)">Business School</a>", Michael is one of the few Dunder Mifflin employees to show up to Pam\'s gallery showing. Unlike Oscar and his then-boyfriend Gil, who had shown up and were critical of Pam\'s drawings (which Pam overheard), Michael immediately marvels at her work and asks to buy Pam\'s drawing of their office building. In a moment of sincere kindness, Michael tells Pam that he is very proud of her. Pam begins to tear up and hugs Michael, who also seems touched by Pam\'s reaction. During "<a href="/wiki/The_Seminar_(The_Office)" class="mw-redirect" title="The Seminar (The Office)">The Seminar</a>", Michael advises a fledgling <a href="/wiki/Andy_Bernard" title="Andy Bernard">Andy Bernard</a> to step up and begin selling at a seminar Andy\'s hosting, in order to boost his sagging sales.</p>\n<p>While Michael\'s habits of joking around and treating professional colleagues as personal friends are often inappropriate for management, they are, along with his near encyclopedic knowledge of the paper industry, remarkably effective when utilized to sign clients, as seen in "<a href="/wiki/The_Client_(The_Office)" title="The Client (The Office)">The Client</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Heavy_Competition" title="Heavy Competition">Heavy Competition</a>." In "<a href="/wiki/Initiation_(The_Office)" title="Initiation (The Office)">Initiation</a>", Pam balks at Michael\'s sugar-fueled phone calls to a local business, but later realizes that his silly conversation (including a <a href="/wiki/Bill_Cosby" title="Bill Cosby">Bill Cosby</a> imitation) helped to secure a major sale for Dunder-Mifflin. He remembers people through word association starting with nicknames such as "baldy" and "fatso" which, while offensive to the individuals in question, works to his advantage. Although he is unsuccessful using his sales methods as a telemarketer in "<a href="/wiki/Money_(The_Office)" title="Money (The Office)">Money</a>", his social interactions with coworkers suggest that he would be a more popular presence in an office of peers as opposed to subordinates.</p>\n<p>It seems clear that Michael loves Dunder Mifflin very much, but he has also shown signs that he sometimes feels underappreciated, given his long history with the company. In the episode "<a href="/wiki/The_Negotiation" title="The Negotiation">The Negotiation</a>", Michael discovers that he is making only slightly more money than Darryl, the warehouse manager, even though at that point he had worked for the company for 14 years and was in a management position. Later in the episode he drives to New York and demands a raise from Jan at corporate headquarters.</p>\n<p>In the episode "<a href="/wiki/New_Boss" title="New Boss">New Boss</a>", after Dunder Mifflin\'s CFO David Wallace ducks Michael\'s calls throughout the day and Michael\'s 15-year anniversary party is cancelled by Michael\'s new superior, Charles Miner, Michael drives to New York to confront Wallace. Citing his long history of service with the company and his many sacrifices for Dunder Mifflin, Michael asks that he be treated more respectfully. Wallace, seeing Michael\'s heartfelt openness, promises Michael his party and pledges to attend, as well. But Michael surprisingly recognizes that the CFO is just humoring him, and stuns Wallace by quitting his job.</p>\n<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationships">Relationships</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Relationships">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Michael tends to overestimate his importance to his employees, but despite constantly offending some of them, he has a close bond with them. Most of the employees have been the focus of Michael\'s jokes at one point or another, usually in reference to their race, sex, size, attractiveness, or sexual orientation. Examples of Michael\'s difficult relationship with his staff include getting slapped by Kelly for being racist, hitting Meredith with his car, getting kicked out of Phyllis and Bob\'s wedding, and <a href="/wiki/Outing" title="Outing">outing</a> Oscar to the entire office without his permission. They are, however, generally sympathetic to his shortcomings and, while regularly losing patience when he interrupts their workflow, often try to assist him with his personal problems.</p>\n<p>Michael\'s relationship with the company warehouse employees is tense. He has a tendency to disrupt their daily work flow, and in a talking head interview, warehouse supervisor <a href="/wiki/Darryl_Philbin" title="Darryl Philbin">Darryl Philbin</a> (<a href="/wiki/Craig_Robinson_(actor)" title="Craig Robinson (actor)">Craig Robinson</a>) explains that they have never been able to make a full year accident-free because of Michael\'s antics. <a href="/wiki/CFO" class="mw-redirect" title="CFO">CFO</a> <a href="/wiki/David_Wallace_(The_Office)" title="David Wallace (The Office)">David Wallace</a> tolerates Michael\'s antics because he values his loyalty to the company, but Michael offends <a href="/wiki/CEO" class="mw-redirect" title="CEO">CEO</a> Allan and the rest of the executives during his only meeting with them.</p>\n<p>Although many Dunder Mifflin employees are initially barely able to tolerate Michael, they gradually grow to appreciate his sincere intentions, even at times coming to find amusement in his sophomoric humor and behavior; this transition is most apparent in <a href="/wiki/Pam_Halpert" class="mw-redirect" title="Pam Halpert">Pam Halpert</a>, with whom he eventually develops a genuine friendship. His co-workers are overjoyed when Michael finds his soulmate in <a href="/wiki/Holly_Flax" title="Holly Flax">Holly Flax</a>, participate in his romantic proposal to her and are shown to be emotional at his leaving Scranton to be with her. Jim Halpert even teared up while calling Michael "the best boss [he] ever had."</p>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dwight_Schrute">Dwight Schrute</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Dwight Schrute">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Dwight has the most respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and is thrilled when asked to handle any task given to him, however ill-conceived it may be. Although on the surface, Michael usually appears dismissive of Dwight and generally views him as a suck-up, he is genuinely hurt and angry at the few times when Dwight has deceived him, such as when Dwight went over Michael\'s head to vie for the manager\'s job or when Dwight refused to reveal office secrets to Michael\'s new company, the Michael Scott Paper Company. In the episode "<a href="/wiki/Heavy_Competition" title="Heavy Competition">Heavy Competition</a>" of Season 5, Dwight steals Michael\'s <a href="/wiki/Rolodex" title="Rolodex">Rolodex</a> and finds his own business card, on the back of which, Michael had written (before leaving Dunder Mifflin): "Dwight Schrute, tall, beets". Michael also cares how Dwight feels about him. After Michael beats Dwight at his own dojo, Michael finds out that Dwight no longer wanted Michael as his primary contact in case of an emergency which causes Michael to promote him from "Assistant to the Regional Manager" to "Assistant Regional Manager", with a three-month probational period. Dwight told Michael in Season 6 that Michael\'s pathetic career path hurt Dwight and he regretted working for him instead of taking a fast-track job at <a href="/wiki/Home_Depot" class="mw-redirect" title="Home Depot">Home Depot</a>, but they buried their differences later on. When Deangelo Vickers arrives to be the new Branch Manager, Dwight is depressed that he didn\'t get the job after Michael recommended him, only to learn from Gabe that Michael didn\'t recommend him after all. At first Dwight is angry with Michael, but they make amends when Michael gives him a letter of recommendation on his final day at Dunder Mifflin. They end the day with a paintball fight behind the building. In the <a href="/wiki/Finale_(The_Office)" title="Finale (The Office)">series finale</a>, Michael is the best man at Dwight\'s wedding after Jim arranges it.</p>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ryan_Howard">Ryan Howard</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Ryan Howard">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Michael has a one-sided <a href="/wiki/Mancrush" class="mw-redirect" title="Mancrush">mancrush</a> on Ryan, which makes Ryan uncomfortable. Examples of this are when Michael gave Ryan a $400 <a href="/wiki/IPod" title="IPod">iPod</a> for the staff\'s Christmas Secret Santa exchange, despite an agreed upon office limit of $20 per person, and when in "<a href="/wiki/The_Dundies" title="The Dundies">The Dundies</a>", Michael gives Ryan the "Hottest in the Office" award. Michael appears to view Ryan both as an idolized friend, such as when he grew a goatee just because Ryan also grew one, and as a son, which he says he views Ryan as in "<a href="/wiki/Secret_Santa_(The_Office)" title="Secret Santa (The Office)">Secret Santa</a>". In "<a href="/wiki/The_Deposition_(The_Office)" title="The Deposition (The Office)">The Deposition</a>", a page from Michael\'s diary reveals he describes Ryan as being "just as hot as Jan, but in a different way." He is horrified when he finds out about Ryan\'s arrest for fraud, and much to the dismay of David Wallace, he re-hires Ryan despite the fact that he was fired by corporate office for his crime. He later earns Ryan\'s respect when Ryan sees Michael\'s talents as a salesman over the phone. In "<a href="/wiki/Prince_Family_Paper" title="Prince Family Paper">Prince Family Paper</a>", Michael acknowledges that his heart has led him astray before, naming Jan and Ryan as examples of this. In Season 7, Michael shows the full gamut of his ties to Ryan: he heavily invests in WUPHF.com and won\'t agree to sell his majority shares when it\'s clear Ryan is incapable of saving the venture from bankruptcy, although Ryan exploits Michael\'s goodwill in their friendship to keep his venture going. But Ryan is later stunned when Michael later calls out his negative qualities and makes it clear Ryan only has nine days with no wiggle room before he fails everyone. Michael is later relieved when Ryan sells the project and everyone gets their money back. Ryan later appears as part of the group to help Michael brainstorm a perfect proposal to Holly.</p>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jim_and_Pam_Halpert">Jim and Pam Halpert</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Jim and Pam Halpert">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Michael doesn\'t hesitate to compliment or criticize Pam for her looks and he frequently mentions her breasts. In the episode "<a href="/wiki/Diwali_(The_Office)" title="Diwali (The Office)">Diwali</a>" Michael mistakenly thinks that he and Pam have a connection, and is rejected when he tries to kiss her. Throughout their relationship, Pam has served as something of a <a href="/wiki/Shoulder_angel" title="Shoulder angel">shoulder angel</a> for Michael by encouraging him to be more productive and discouraging his bad ideas, with varying degrees of success. She grows closer to Michael as he supports her goals in pursuing sales and art. Pam is visibly touched when, after many art show attendees dismiss her artwork, Michael is so impressed that he asks to buy her painting of their office building. Their relationship comes to a rocky point when he begins dating her mother Helene. This is only repaired after he breaks up with Helene and allows Pam to slap him in the face in the parking lot. He trusts and respects Jim, although when they were co-managers they clashed due to their polar-opposite management styles. In "<a href="/wiki/Secret_Santa_(The_Office)" title="Secret Santa (The Office)">Secret Santa</a>", Michael mentions that in a future vision he sees himself and his future wife living next door to Jim and Pam and that their children will play together. He often also refers to Jim as his best friend in the office, although, based on his impersonation of Jim using surfer slang in "<a href="/wiki/Michael%27s_Last_Dundies" title="Michael\'s Last Dundies">Michael\'s Last Dundies</a>", does not have a very good understanding of his personality. While Jim and Pam are both shown to care about Michael, his clingy nature makes them reluctant to socialize with him outside of the office; such as when, after numerous unsuccessful invitations, Michael is forced to trick them in order to have them over for a disastrous dinner in the episode "<a href="/wiki/Dinner_Party_(The_Office)" title="Dinner Party (The Office)">Dinner Party</a>." In a Season 5 episode, Michael also shows his admiration for Jim, when Jim wears a tuxedo to work and goes on and on about having a \'classy party\' for the party planning committee, and frequently suggests all of the ideas Dwight had offered that Michael had then rejected, only to bother Dwight by having Michael accept the same ideas from him. During Cecilia Halpert\'s baptism, Michael approaches Pam referring to himself as "the godfather" while imitating <a href="/wiki/Vito_Corleone" title="Vito Corleone">Don Corleone</a>, after which she sympathetically but emphatically asks him to acknowledge that he won\'t be Cece\'s godfather, he is disappointed but does so and is hurt to learn that the godparents are a couple they\'d only recently met. Pam is shown to have a soft spot for Michael, consoling him after he finds Holly to be in a relationship with AJ, and her advising him on ideas on how to propose to Holly. In "<a href="/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael" title="Goodbye, Michael">Goodbye, Michael</a>" it is revealed that Michael is secretly planning to leave for Colorado at the end of his penultimate work day, thereby avoiding having to say goodbye to everyone. Jim figures this out and goes along with it, telling Michael that he will tell him what a great boss he was the following day at lunch, which they both know Michael will not be around for; Michael and Jim both get sentimental during this final conversation between them. The strength of his relationship with Pam is revealed as he continuously asks about her whereabouts, not wanting to leave without saying goodbye. Pam, who spent the better part of the day away from the office, finds Michael at the airport and says goodbye in a touching scene just as he\'s about to board his plane for Colorado. She watches from the window as his plane flies off. In a deleted scene of "<a href="/wiki/The_Inner_Circle_(The_Office)" title="The Inner Circle (The Office)">The Inner Circle</a>", Pam is flattered that Michael named his new dog "Pamela Beasley." Pam later teases Jim that their second child will be named "little Michael Scott" displaying the friendship she had developed with her former boss.</p>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Toby_Flenderson">Toby Flenderson</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Toby Flenderson">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Despite liking the majority of the staff, Michael fiercely hates <a href="/wiki/Human_Resources_Manager" class="mw-redirect" title="Human Resources Manager">Human Resources Manager</a> Toby Flenderson, likely due to Toby\'s requirement to enforce the rules of proper office behavior that Michael loves to flout. Michael once reasoned that "Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for Corporate. So he\'s really not a part of our family. He\'s also divorced so he\'s not a part of <i>his</i> family either". His longtime goal is to get rid of Toby and any attempts at reconciliation between the two usually backfire, with Michael resorting to name calling or jokes at Toby\'s expense. In the episode "<a href="/wiki/Goodbye,_Toby" title="Goodbye, Toby">Goodbye, Toby</a>", Michael is thrilled when Toby decides to move to <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a> and gives as his going away present a rock with a note that reads "Suck on this". The next season, after Toby\'s replacement Holly is transferred, Michael is horrified when Toby returns to Dunder Mifflin. In "<a href="/wiki/Frame_Toby" title="Frame Toby">Frame Toby</a>", he goes to great lengths to get him fired, trying to frame him for possession of <a href="/wiki/Marijuana" class="mw-redirect" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> (which turns out to be a caprese salad).

In "<a href="/wiki/Nepotism_(The_Office)" title="Nepotism (The Office)">Nepotism</a>", after Michael spanks Luke, the office intern who is also his nephew, he is ordered to attend counseling sessions moderated by Toby, much to Michael\'s horror.

In "<a href="/wiki/Classy_Christmas" title="Classy Christmas">Classy Christmas</a>", Michael is happy to hear the news that Toby is going to be on a leave of absence for jury duty and that Holly will be taking his place.

In "<a href="/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael" title="Goodbye, Michael">Goodbye, Michael</a>", Michael is seen saying goodbye to Toby without insulting him, possibly indicating that he will miss Toby on some level.

Unlike her predecessor, Erin loves working as a receptionist, admires Michael and cheerfully accommodates many of his unusual requests (such as serving him a plate of <a href="/wiki/Ants_on_a_log" title="Ants on a log">ants on a log</a> every day at 2:30 and spinning him in his chair until he\'s dizzy) that Pam likely would have been apprehensive about. Although he generally enjoys Erin\'s thoughtful treatment, his dismissive feelings towards Erin continue until "<a href="/wiki/Secretary%27s_Day_(The_Office)" title="Secretary\'s Day (The Office)">Secretary\'s Day</a>" when he reluctantly agrees to take her out to lunch.

Later that day, Michael apologizes to Erin; the two are finally able to relate to each other over their mutual fondness for silly humor, stemming from their similar immature tendencies (with Michael\'s ignorance and Erin\'s na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9). Their working relationship then develops smoothly while they bond by making each other laugh with childish jokes, such as Erin pointing out that the phrase "it\'s not" sounds like "snot." In "<a href="/wiki/Viewing_Party" title="Viewing Party">Viewing Party</a>", Erin throws a <i><a href="/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)" title="Glee (TV series)">Glee</a></i> party with her new boyfriend, <a href="/wiki/Gabe_Lewis_(The_Office)" class="mw-redirect" title="Gabe Lewis (The Office)">Gabe Lewis</a>. Throughout the night, she unsuccessfully attempts to get Michael and Gabe to bond. Michael is jealous that the office looks to Gabe as the boss and attempts to sabotage the party. After being confronted by Erin in private, Michael questions why his opinion matters so much to her as he is not her father. In a moment of insight, Michael realizes that Erin, who was raised in foster care, does indeed look to him as a father figure and he instigates a playful fight as father and daughter by saying "go to your room, young lady!" Erin becomes protective of Michael to the point where she is hostile towards Holly Flax, saying in a talking head interview that she doesn\'t understand what Michael sees in her, until <i><a href="/wiki/The_Search_(The_Office)" title="The Search (The Office)">The Search</a></i> when she, Dwight and Holly go searching for a missing Michael. Erin sees that Holly is able to sense where Michael is, and when she sees them reconcile, she finally understands their love for each other and smiles. Later in "<a href="/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael" title="Goodbye, Michael">Goodbye, Michael</a>", Erin talks to Michael about her love life and wishes that she knew her birth mother so she could tell Erin what to do. Michael advises Erin that she shouldn\'t rush things and that she\'ll know what to do when the right guy comes along. Michael then tells her that she won\'t need her mother for advice, because she will always have his personal phone number when she needs advice and kisses her on the head.</p>\n<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Holly_Flax">Holly Flax</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Scott_(The_Office)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Holly Flax">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Shortly after the dissolution of his troubled relationship with Jan, Michael found love with <a href="/wiki/Holly_Flax" title="Holly Flax">Holly Flax</a> (<a href="/wiki/Amy_Ryan" title="Amy Ryan">Amy Ryan</a>), Toby\'s replacement as HR Representative, who appears for a while to be Michael\'s best chance at love, with the two sharing a similar sense of humor and social awkwardness. However, after David Wallace witnesses them kissing, Holly is transferred to the <a href="/wiki/Nashua,_New_Hampshire" title="Nashua, New Hampshire">Nashua</a> branch and she and Michael break up after choosing not to pursue a long-distance relationship. Despite the breakup and Holly\'s new relationship with another man, their affection for each other doesn\'t go away, as it\'s shown that Holly had been writing a note for Michael on her work computer, as well as their subtle romantic glances at one another during the summer company picnic. Throughout her absence in Season 5 (excluding Company Picnic) and carrying on into Season 7, Michael hooks up with a few other women, but ultimately he realizes that they\'re nothing compared to her. Around Christmas in Season 7, Toby is forced to leave the office due to being selected as part of the jury duty for a local murder case, resulting in Holly returning as the temporary HR replacement. There\'s initial tension between the two of them and hesitation on her side (mostly after her sudden break-up with A.J.), but Holly finally reunites with Michael after realizing they\'re both soulmates. The two continue dating for a few weeks, and on Valentine\'s Day, they tell each other they love each other, decide to move in together, and resolve that they will not allow Dunder Mifflin to interfere with their future together. With her time at the Scranton branch almost up and the recent knowledge that her aging parents need to be taken care of, they ultimately become fiancees. Holly later moves back to Colorado and Michael follows her soon after. In the finale it is revealed that they have children together.

After Michael fails to defend Jan in her <a href="/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal" title="Wrongful dismissal">Wrongful Dismissal suit</a> against Dunder Mifflin, they remain together for a short while, but end up blowing up at each other during an ill-fated dinner party and eventually break up. He also dated Carol (played by Carell\'s wife <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Carell" title="Nancy Carell">Nancy Walls</a>), a real estate agent from whom Michael bought his condominium. Michael was much more interested in Carol than vice versa, and after he made an unwanted and rejected impromptu public marriage proposal, Michael\'s decision to <a href="/wiki/Photo_manipulation#Photoshopped" title="Photo manipulation">Photoshop</a> pictures of himself over Carol\'s ex-husband in her family pictures resulted in their breakup. On a business trip to Winnipeg, Michael &amp; "Concierge Marie" become close, and Michael does not wish to leave her after they are caught necking in her suite. After Jim and Pam\'s wedding, Michael begins dating Pam\'s mother Helene (much to Pam\'s horror), but he breaks up with her on her birthday after discovering she is turning 58. Near the end of season six, Michael begins dating Donna (<a href="/wiki/Amy_Pietz" title="Amy Pietz">Amy Pietz</a>), the manager of a local bar, but later finds out that she\'s married and he is, as he puts it, "the mistress".

Whereas Brent is shown to be irredeemably incompetent, Scott is portrayed as an outstanding salesman who is unwisely promoted to a management role to which he appears completely ill-suited. (In a scathing performance review during episode eight of season two, <a href="/wiki/Jan_Levinson" title="Jan Levinson">Jan Levinson</a> suggests that Scott should be removed from his management role and return to sales). Scott is thus an apt example of the <a href="/wiki/Peter_Principle" class="mw-redirect" title="Peter Principle">Peter Principle</a> which states that competent persons in a hierarchical organization will "rise to the level of their incompetence" after which they will not advance.</p>\n<p>Despite his failings, Scott has been oddly successful as regional manager. This is attributed, in part, to his weakness of procrastination wherein he typically forfeits a bad choice by seeking the advice of his more competent subordinates (such as Jim, Oscar, or Darryl) and uses their recommendations. Scott\'s success is also partly attributed to his main strength: genuinely caring about the well-being of the office and treating his employees like family. When he took over the Scranton Branch he decreased costs by 17%, without firing any personnel. After the merger of the two branches Scott does not lose a single client despite a great deal of employee turnover (much of which he was directly responsible for). He received a $3,000 bonus for firing Devon, most likely because his doing so saved the company around $50,000. Although it is suggested that Brent has had similar success, such claims only ever come from Brent himself, thus making them unreliable.</p>\n<p>Scott\'s social immaturity and inability to cope with responsibility is balanced with a personality that is much more caring than Brent\'s, even if both make unwise comments in the heat of the moment. Unlike Brent, who pretends to be friendly with many of his employees purely for the benefit of the cameras, Scott seems to genuinely like his colleagues, with the exception of Human Resources Director <a href="/wiki/Toby_Flenderson" title="Toby Flenderson">Toby Flenderson</a>. Scott\'s need to be liked by his staff and his belief that people see him as a genuine friend leads him to become very hurt when he realizes this is not the case. Most, if not all, of Scott\'s managerial blunders can be directly correlated with the degree to which he desires to be liked by his employees or jealously seeks their approval.</p>\n<p>The <a href="/wiki/DVD_commentary" class="mw-redirect" title="DVD commentary">DVD commentary</a> to the pilot episode suggests that Scott\'s character continues a process begun in the second UK series, in which Gervais and Merchant intentionally made Brent less nasty, and more of a <a href="/wiki/Buffoon" class="mw-redirect" title="Buffoon">buffoon</a>. It is said in the commentary that Gervais and Merchant suggested that this be applied to Scott. This also reflects a general change in the US version\'s attitude, which is more sympathetic to the characters, and tones down the cruel humor of the original. The commentary also says that Steve Carell had not seen more than a few minutes of the original UK series when he was offered the role of Scott, and has since made a conscious decision not to watch it in case it influences his own performance.</p>\n<p>The show\'s writers have said that the 2005 hit movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_40-Year-Old_Virgin" title="The 40-Year-Old Virgin">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a></i> provided very useful guidance as they refined the character along with Steve Carell between the 1st and 2nd seasons. Michael Scott wore a large amount of hair gel and dressed sloppily in Season 1, but by Season 2 he had a more conventional haircut and dressed much more neatly.
