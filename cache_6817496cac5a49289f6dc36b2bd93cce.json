However, I think that, even as an encyclopedia article rather than a book, it would be good to address the basics in a way suitable for someone with no prior knowledge. That would involve explaining the elementary constructions from which all others are derived (a noticeable omission at present) Each of these would ideally be illustrated by a simple diagram. It would be useful to relate these constructions to the complex arithmetic viewpoint, then show (or at least state) that combining these is enough to provide all of the operations required. The article would then be a more solid looking introduction. However, what wikipedia needs is people who do, not people who say what might be good to do! <a href="/wiki/User:Elroch" title="User:Elroch">Elroch</a> 00:58, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>I can\'t quite agree with you. Sometime we do have too many sidewalk superintendents; but I\'d appreciate some guidance. Don\'t worry about your graphics expertise; I have plenty of that. I <i>don\'t</i> have your deep mathematical background and I <i>don\'t</i> have your insight into what a non-graphics person wants to see. Consider me your pen and ink. What would you draw?</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>Do you want me to re-illustrate <i>The Elements</i>, perhaps dynamically? Just the first few propositions? The postulates and common notions only? Let\'s do it this way: Name <b>one</b> or, perhaps, three graphics you want to see; give me a bit of a lead on what features you want to see <i>in</i> them.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>I\'m not too clear on what you mean by relating constructions to complex arithmetic. Do you mean to say, <i>Demonstrate constructions on the Cartesian plane</i>? I can do that.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>I can do a fair amount, either with detailed illustrations or simple animations. Would you take a look at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Pi/Unrolled&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pi/Unrolled (page does not exist)">Pi/Unrolled</a>? I\'m sure you appreciate that I don\'t want to invest that level of effort in <i>every</i> diagram (it was probably overkill for that application); but I\'ll entertain requests of merit.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>Talk to me. <a href="/wiki/User:John_Reid" title="User:John Reid">John Reid</a> 01:16, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>It\'s my pleasure to do so&#160;:-) By the way, the illustration of Pi/Unrolled is delightful - I will watch it to relax!</dd>\n<dd>My concept is really rather a simple one. There are only a small number of one step constructions that you can do with compass and straightedge, each of would be well-illustrated by one or two diagrams. Off the top of my head, we can produce: exactly one line from two distinct points; one circle with radius the distance between two distinct points and centre a specified point; up to one new point from two lines; up to two new points from a circle and a line; and up to two points from two circles.</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>Each of these last three constructions of new points can be expressed unambiguously as a formula in the points used to construct the lines and circles, viewed as complex numbers, taking account of the different cases. (Of course all this can be expressed using vector operations instead, but complex arithmetic seems easier to me, although maybe not to a reader who was not already familiar with the complex numbers). Combining these constructions in certain ways permits us to do the arithmetic operations mentioned in the article. That\'s about all a reader needs to know to prepare them for life as a geometer&#160;:-) <a href="/wiki/User:Elroch" title="User:Elroch">Elroch</a> 01:56, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Hm. Well, it looks like you <i>do</i> want illustrations of the Postulates: "A straight line can be drawn between two points." "A circle can be drawn with any radius and center." At least, that\'s how I see it. Then maybe you want some illustrations of Definitions: "This is a point."</p>\n<p>I dunno, this kind of work could go on and on. The standard, popular web version of The Elements is <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html">[1]</a>; it\'s huge and detailed. Personally, I hate it because it uses Java; that makes it interactive as well as dynamic, but then I hate Java, period; I refuse to enable it in my browser. But the rest of the world doesn\'t seem to mind. How far do we want to duplicate this work?</p>\n<p>Rather than try to produce a dimwit version of Elements -- crank out the definitions, the postulates, the common notions, and the first 5 postulates before burning out in a wave of massive ennui -- I\'d rather we tried beforehand to isolate the most interesting, misunderstood, or controversial constructions. For instance, it might be worthwhile illustrating I.2 and .3, to show that the collapsing compass constraint is avoidable. The parallel postulate should be illustrated all 3 ways, although for obvious reasons not all dumped into Euclidean articles. I can see some value in illustrations that attempt to show the <i>ideal</i> nature of circle and line; but it would just be a massive, useless drag to go much further down the exhaustive road. That way lies cruft. Interested readers should be steered away from our general reference work onto specific external elucidations of Elements.</p>\n<p>As far as "complex numbers" are concerned, I think I have to declare a bias here. I have an EE background (among others) and the complex plane has a specific, concrete meaning for me. I know you call it <i>i</i>, but I think of it as <i>j</i>, and it refers to phase lag (or lead). I certainly deal with the Cartesian plane every day, but then it\'s just <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and neither is preferred over the other. But when <i>you</i> say complex plane, I think you mean the real numbers along the horizontal axis and the imaginary numbers along the vertical. Correct? My point being is that I doubt you can pound enough sense into my head that I can feel comfortable in that middle ground. To me, it\'s either a neutral x-y plane or a representation of phase in a signal.</p>\n<p>So, I\'m not sure I see the value in showing Euclid married to the <b>complex</b> plane. If you say, well, I want to see Euclid in Cartesian space, okay, I can certainly buy that. I think it\'s the kind of illustration that belongs in <a href="/wiki/Analytic_geometry" title="Analytic geometry">Analytic geometry</a>, though. Isn\'t the whole point of Euclid\'s view of geometry that he manages to do it entirely without algebra? <a href="/wiki/User:John_Reid" title="User:John Reid">John Reid</a> 10:50, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>The value is that using this viewpoint is very enlightening about the mathematics, as the article indicates, rather like an article about finding roots of polynomials is enlightened by Galois theory. Some theorems in both areas are probably very cumbersome or impractical without using some extra tools. For example, I don\'t think Euclid would have possessed the language to characterise exactly which points may be constructed, but this is rather simple from the complex viewpoint. My understanding is that the article is about the area of mathematics, rather than being restricted to Euclid\'s viewpoint. I must confess it was only after I added the first draft of the section on constructions as complex arithmetic that I realised that most of it was covered in different language in a section written earlier (still to be merged), so I am not unique in this viewpoint. By the way, the section relating to complex arithmetic points out that if you deal with ratios, the only arbitrary choice is that of an orientation. (i.e if you take a cartesian plane and view it as the complex numbers in any way that preserves orthogonality, complex ratios are invariant except for an arbitrary choice which swaps i and -i for all the ratios).</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>My response to your request for suggestions was basically just that I think the article would be enhanced by a graphic for each of the five elementary constructions mentioned above. This is the dictionary of the language of compass and straightedge geometry, in which all constructions are written. At present we mention that this exists, but don\'t actually specify what it is, which is less than ideal. What do you think?</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>There is no need to link the constructions to complex arithmetic. I am happy to deal with this, to justify the claims already made in the article. <a href="/wiki/User:Elroch" title="User:Elroch">Elroch</a> 18:20, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<div class="floatleft"><a href="/wiki/File:Basic-construction-demo.png" class="image"><img alt="Basic-construction-demo.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Basic-construction-demo.png/400px-Basic-construction-demo.png" width="400" height="241" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Basic-construction-demo.png/600px-Basic-construction-demo.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Basic-construction-demo.png 2x" data-file-width="724" data-file-height="436" /></a></div>\n<p>Insofar as we have a conflict of perception, I imagine it\'s rooted in my engineering background. I see classical construction as <i>free</i> from number; Euclid stands to one side and points to this line or that and argues, "These things are alike; therefore <i>these</i> are also alike." Logic prevails and what I like to think of as an algebra-free zone. Naturally, one can <i>switch on</i> algebra, introduce the Cartesian plane (with or without complex numbers); but I just don\'t see any of this as <i>Euclidean</i>.</p>\n<p>I\'m tempted to argue that all such discussion belongs in a distinct article and <a href="/wiki/Compass_and_straightedge" class="mw-redirect" title="Compass and straightedge">Compass and straightedge</a> be restricted to purely Euclidean concepts. This is by way of analogy to the decision to move impossible constructions and forbidden techniques to their own pages.</p>\n<p>The appeal of construction to me, and perhaps to the young learner, is that there is never any need to analyze the construction; it is a purely synthetic discipline. The calculator stays in the backpack. To get a real feel for my viewpoint, let me say in what high regard I hold <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/Euclid/byrne.html">Byrne</a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/Euclid/bookI/images/bookI-1.html">example: Euclid I.1</a>). Byrne dispenses even with the symbolism of labeling points A, B, C, and so on.</p>\n<p>I like to think constructions speak for themselves; no need for analyzing them by way of algebra. I\'m sure there\'s a vast amount of such analysis but this is far over the head of the young learner.</p>\n<p>Let me just say that if you want to impose the Cartesian plane on a few constructions, I\'m willing to help out -- <i>provided</i> they go into a distinct article. <b>So, moving on:</b> Here\'s a demo concept of what I think you want. Tell me if I\'m right or wrong. <a href="/wiki/User:John_Reid" title="User:John Reid">John Reid</a> 05:51, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>You are right in your interpretation. Your graphic is almost complete in covering each of the elementary constructions from which all others are built (the incompleteness is probably explained by me having corrected my earlier post). What we still need is a way to use the compass to draw a circle with radius the distance between two points, and centre a third point (which may, or may not be one of the first two points). As a construction, this is easy to perform, but how can it be illustrated?</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>A minor point is that in the two constructions that define two points, there is sometimes only one point defined and sometimes none, but I think that is of secondary importance (it is easy to find out which occurs if we know which objects are used in the construction).</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>What should and should not be in the article is an interesting issue. I believe the modern approach covered is entirely justified <i>not</i> because it is how one would do compass and straightedge constructions, but because it allows us to see the <i>totality</i> of what can be achieved using compass and straightedge constructions, which is very enlightening. I am firmly of the opinion that this eagle\'s eye viewpoint is highly appropriate for what has to be a short article on a big subject. For similar reasons, explaining the elementary constructions is highly appropriate, because all the constructions that we are unable to cover consist entirely of repeated use of these constructions. <a href="/wiki/User:Elroch" title="User:Elroch">Elroch</a> 16:37, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Sorry, I think I have to disagree with construction of a circle as you describe it. That technique is forbidden in the strictest sense, because of the collapsing compass. One is not allowed to set the compass at one pair of points, then move the compass to another place on the page and draw a circle with the given radius. Mastery of I.2 and .3 shows <i>how</i> to get around this restriction; and indeed most constructions are vastly simplified by assuming a non-collapsing compass. But Euclid\'s definition of a compass is a mere circle-drawing tool; it is created anew for each circle and disappears once used.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Thank you for enlightening me with regard to Euclid\'s viewpoint. In that case the construction I was describing is a multi-step construction, and your diagram is a complete list of the fundamental constructions, which greatly enhances the article. (On a pragmatic point, it is difficult to imagine a practical compass that would be adequate to draw a circle using two points, but which one could not move so as to use a third point as the centre.) <a href="/wiki/User:Elroch" title="User:Elroch">Elroch</a> 18:49, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>The issue of what does and does not belong in the article is potentially contentious. My view is that construction on the plane is a <i>fundamental</i> field; it should be presented in terms of its own axioms and understood initially from its own worldview. I don\'t welcome discussion here about Fermat primes and so forth. Algebraic analysis is chiefly useful for proving what construction <i>cannot</i> do; it is not useful as a generator of valid constructions. Constructions must be constructed; it is <i>geometry</i>. There seems, to my eye, something distinctly partaking of the digital age in the efforts to replace clear and obvious diagrams with complex arithmatic.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>To give due credit, I think it should be viewed as a modernism introduced ,probably by <a href="/wiki/Gauss" class="mw-redirect" title="Gauss">Gauss</a> in the late 1700s, and developed by his successors. It would be unfair to the reader to give the impression that the subject of compass and straightedge construction was not developed after Euclid. The algebraic viewpoint can be used to show constructions exist as well as that they don\'t (Gauss was able to show that there existed a construction for every one of the constructible polygons, but did not provide an explicit construction even for the <a href="/wiki/Heptadecagon" title="Heptadecagon">heptadecagon</a>. It was <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Wantzel" title="Pierre Wantzel">Pierre Wantzel</a> who showed that there did not exist a construction for any of the other polygons). Also I would point out that, to a mathematician, a diagram may illustrate a proof and help one understand a proof but is not a proof in itself - this must be a sequence of formal inferences. Diagrams, in themselves, can be misleading - there are many fake geometric constructions which would fool most people. <a href="/wiki/User:Elroch" title="User:Elroch">Elroch</a> 18:49, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Of course, some of this drift may be due to the fact that previous editors have been skilled in the use of TeX while unskilled in graphic arts. I have both tools and skills appropriate to fine, concise illustration of the concepts of plane geometry; and I hope to use them to illuminate the articles in question. Whether or not I can ease algebraic analysis out to pages with which it is concerned is an open question. Certainly the analysis is notable and worthwhile; I can\'t object to it in the project. I\'d only like to see it in its proper place.</p>\n<p>I believe we can go well beyond the five operations diagrammed above without replicating every book of Euclid. Some middle ground should be preferred, with a few notable constructions shown and explained. For instance, I endorse the construction of the regular pentagon; though I think its current location on the page is a bit flashy; I\'d rather it farther down and better explained. Construction of the regular triangle <i>really</i> should be done; bisection of angle and line; and of course Pythagoras should be touched upon, though briefly only at <b>Compass and straightedge</b> itself.</p>\n<p>I would rather take the reader through a complete understanding of construction and proof of a simple proposition in detail, entirely from Euclid\'s point of view, before veering off into modern methods. As I keep reminding specialist editors: This is a <b>general reference</b> work, not a textbook in any field. <a href="/wiki/User:John_Reid" title="User:John Reid">John Reid</a> 01:41, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>\n<p><i>content above copied from <a href="/wiki/User_talk:John_Reid" title="User talk:John Reid">User talk:John Reid</a>.</i></p>\n<p>I value Elroch\'s opinions even though I may not always agree.

In my experience, many mathematicians are more comfortable with simple pictures than abstract symbols. They also prefer having an explanation given with illustrations rather than a mesh of symbols. I find it puzzling that you equate what you actually wrote with "mathematicians are generally poor illustrators". This new assertion is about the level of expertise in illustrating that mathematicians have. That\'s quite debatable also, as while I haven\'t found mathematicians in general to be great artists, many are quite capable of drawing simple illustrations that effectively demonstrate a mathematical concept.

A static illustration is hard to present clearly, because we would like to see, not just a path, but a <i>deformation</i> of that path. And worse, we want to see that a certain deformation is impossible, something we cannot literally show.

The \xcf\x80/6 arc needs a larger radius to \xe2\x80\x9cread\xe2\x80\x9d clearly. The digits are noticeably bolder than the \xcf\x80 they accompany. The solidus seems too wide; consider kerning or using \xe2\x80\x9c<sup>2\xcf\x80</sup>\xe2\x81\x84<sub>5</sub>\xe2\x80\x9d style (&lt;sup&gt;2\xcf\x80&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;frasl;=U+2044). Consider using the same partition for the equilateral triangle and square as for the other regular polygons. Otherwise, it\'s visually clean. However, I would recommend using a gallery of separate images rather than one large composite. Among other benefits, it increases the possible uses. --<a href="/wiki/User:KSmrq" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:KSmrq" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 20:47, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Thank you for your comments, KS. I considered some of the issues you raised. Let me discuss them and perhaps you\'ll be able to show me a way out.</p>\n<p>I used the same "local unit" circle to create all the measure arcs. I agree that this makes the \xcf\x80/6 arc too short but I didn\'t want to violate this standard. The two instances of \xcf\x80/4 are a bit strained, too. If I could think of a good justification for using a "bigger" arc, I\'d entertain the idea.</p>\n<p>Using the same partition for the triangle aggravates the arc problem. The square could probably be as small as the higher-degree polygons but the space is there anyway. Also, the square and triangle indicate right angles and that symbol takes up some room. That can probably be managed; if you can see a way out of the arc "size" problem, I\'d be open to all sorts of resizing.</p>\n<p>I\'m not too happy with the label text in general. I started with better-looking text but when the image is scaled, both line widths and text look crappy. (Check out the <a class="external text" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/9d/20061102214745%21Radian-common.png">prior upload</a> on the same image page.) So, I went back and bolded everything. The actual symbol for \xcf\x80 is a huge problem. Most font designers don\'t bother to design it; they just steal it from another font. So, there isn\'t much choice in presentation and you don\'t usually get a bold symbol in a bold font. Some just look ugly. The white space around the virgule is a product of patching a fixed-up symbol over the weak font symbol. To tell the truth, I actually prefer a horizontal fraction bar but that shape may not fit well in the diagram.</p>\n<p>I can fix the text better than this but I think, in the end, I\'ll have to demand a larger display in the article. There\'s just too much info here to squeeze down.</p>\n<p>You\'ll need to talk more about a gallery of separate images. By putting all the figures in one image, I get to pack them in more closely; also, I needn\'t worry that they\'ll get munged when someone is editing text.</p>\n<p>Mostly, I didn\'t want to throw too much work into the diagram until I had the angles checked. I use some of these constantly but others are obscure and, well, you never know when you\'ve stubbed your toe until somebody points it out.

That is, a central angle of 2\xcf\x80/3 corresponds to an arc of that length. Thus we can measure angles by measuring lengths. This is one reason why radians are so natural for mathematics purposes, while degrees are more awkward and artificial.

An angle of 1 radian is an <i>irrational</i> angle -- forgive me if the term seems misapplied. For that matter, it is not contructible. It is, essentially, a silly angle. I don\'t doubt that the diagram has its uses but it\'s not a good introduction. I say this with authority; my students often have trouble wrapping their brains around 1 radian but when I explain that a full circle is 2\xcf\x80, a line is \xcf\x80, a right angle \xcf\x80/2 and so forth, they light up. This presumes that they have a good grasp of \xcf\x80 in the first place, of course.</p>\n<p>Degrees are, of course, superstitious bumf. I have a clever little astrological chart made up that shows how primitive priest-astronomers stumbled on the fact that the sun goes around the earth in 360 days. Further refinements to the contrary, we are still stuck with this ancient measurement. (For that matter, perhaps we should be grateful. The nicely factorable 360 no doubt helped a lot of early geometers work stuff out; the error of 5.2425 helped to provoke all kinds of science and to dethrone mysticism.)</p>\n<p>I took the easy way out by demonstrating the common polygon angles. I think this is the most useful explanation but it is not direct. Also, sooner or later one needs to hit 1 radian -- all the integer, irrational angles.

I want to start adding images here at some point, but none of these formats are any good here. I\'ve searched the net, and there are some (mostly commercial) conversion programs to convert each of those files to an SVG file, but the ones I tried tend to make a mess of the graphic (especially the fonts). There was a really good one, pdf2svg, but at $500+ for a license, I think I\'ll pass. So, long story short, is there any reliable way to have latex output to an SVG file?

I have a few ideas to improve the suspension of the 0-sphere. Instead of having <i>X</i> in plain black, we could show <i>X</i> as the union of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> with overlapping colors (similarly to <i>A</i> intersect <i>B</i>), and add this in the labeling. Also, could you change the color of <i>A</i> to blue, and the color of <i>B</i> to red so that everything stays consistent (and have the labels colored as well)? Finally, I find the labeling too condensed below, so I propose to put the names of the objects (<i>Y</i>, <i>X</i> = <i>A</i>\xe2\x88\xaa<i>B</i>, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>A</i>\xe2\x88\xa9<i>B</i>) above the pictures, and the descriptions (S^0, SY = S^1, ~pt, ~pt, ~Y = S^0) below.

The graphic there is fine, but a little cluttered to take in all at once. I had the idea that an animated reveal would make the graphic communicate better. I have uploaded a modified version of the graphic which slowly reveals the components in the order they are mentioned in the caption. The animated version of the graphic can be found here: <a class="external free" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Johnsons_Theorem_animated.svg">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Johnsons_Theorem_animated.svg</a> I have tested it alone in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. I found I had to make the initial state all visibile, otherwise it showed up as blank in the wikimedia file view. Also, when I test-edited it into the Wikipedia page, the preview wouldn\'t animate unless I clicked to bring it up alone. The modifications to add the reveal animation were pretty simple, and animated svg\'s seem so superior to an image sequence. Rather than modify the Johnson\'s Circles page, I thought I would mention it here to see if this seems like a good idea or not, or if there are any suggestions. <a href="/wiki/User:Dsmccoy" title="User:Dsmccoy">Dsmccoy</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Dsmccoy" title="User talk:Dsmccoy">talk</a>) 00:58, 3 December 2012 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>If you look at <a href="/wiki/SVG_animation" title="SVG animation">SVG animation</a> you\'ll see that the wikipedia software automatically generates static, non-animated thumbnails of SVG images.
